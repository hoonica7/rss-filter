      <title>Laser-engineered $\Gamma$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08068v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.</description>

      <title>Hidden frustration in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd3P3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of the magnetic ground state and crystal electric field (CEF) scheme in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd$_3$P$_3$. Combined neutron scattering, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements demonstrate that the Nd$^{3+}$ moments occupying the triangular lattice in this material harbor hidden signs of frustration not detected in typical Curie-Weiss-based parameterization of the frustration index ($f=\Theta_{CW} / T_N$). This is evidenced by a zero-field splitting of the Kramers' ground state and first excited state doublets at temperatures far in excess of $T_N$ as well as signatures of low-energy fluctuations for $T&gt;&gt;T_N$. A suppression of the zero-field ordered moment relative to its field saturation value is observed, and the impacts of this magnetic frustration as well as the coexisting bond frustration in the CdP honeycomb network on the physical properties of NdCd$_3$P$_3$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>Structural Phase Separation and Enhanced Superconductivity in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 under Uniaxial Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its capability in tuning lattice and electronic structures of quantum materials. Using moderate uniaxial compressive strain, we induce structural phase separation in the low-temperature phase of x=1/8 La2-xBaxCuO4 (LBCO) single crystals. These structures are low temperature tetragonal (LTT), low temperature less orthorhombic (LTLO), and a plastically deformed nano-domain structure (PDNS), comprised of few-nanometer-sized orthorhombic domains within an amorphous matrix. These three structures exhibit distinct superconducting behaviors. The volume fraction of the LTT structure is suppressed with increasing strain, while its superconducting transition temperature increases and broadens. The LTLO structure exhibits a sharp superconducting transition above 32 K, which increases up to ~36 K at maximum strain. The PDNS phase exhibits a very broad superconducting transition and persists even after removing the strain. Our study illustrates the sensitivity of superconductivity to the structure of the LBCO sample near its stripe instability.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2: From bilayer to the twisted bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 possesses both a high Curie temperature and robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, holding promise for practical spintronic applications. In particular, understanding and engineering its Gilbert damping which determines magnetization dynamics are crucial for its applications. Here, we investigate the Gilbert damping of bilayer and the twisted bilayer Fe3GaTe2 through first-principles calculations. For the bilayer Fe3GaTe2, we obtain a quite low Gilbert damping when its magnetization is along the z axis at room temperature. In addition, the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 exhibits a large orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping when its magnetization is rotated from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. Such anisotropy is attributed to the distinct band structures caused by the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. Surprisingly, we find that twisting the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 can effectively reduce the Gilbert damping for the perpendicular magnetization, and enhance the orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping up to 635% when rotating the magnetization from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. These findings open up an entirely new avenue for the manipulation of Gilbert damping and its anisotropy in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e excitons in generalized Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices of transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers host strong Coulomb interactions residing in narrow electron bands, leading to correlated insulating states at fractional carrier doping densities, known as generalized Wigner crystals. In excited states, the formation of moir\'e excitons is expected to be fundamentally shaped by the Wigner-crystal ground states, manifesting an intricate interplay between electronic and excitonic correlations. However, the microscopic description of these Wigner crystalline excitons (WCEs) remains elusive, largely subject to speculations, and is further needed for the understanding of exotic excitonic phases (e.g., exciton insulators and exciton density waves) and their unique properties (e.g., anomalous exciton diffusion). Here, using first-principles many-body GW-Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations, we directly reveal the internal structures of WCEs in angle-aligned MoSe2/MoS2 moir\'e heterostructure at hole fillings of 1/3 and 2/3. Our results unveil the propagation of correlation effects from the ground state to excited states, shaping the real-space characteristics of WCEs. The strong two-particle excitonic correlations dominate over the kinetic energy of free electron-hole pairs, in analog to the strong single-particle correlations of flat bands. We propose that such unusual excited-state correlation effects of WCEs can be experimentally probed by photocurrent tunneling microscopy. Our work provides a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated WCEs, suggesting them as a highly tunable mixed boson-fermion platform to study many-body interactions and phenomena.</description>

      <title>Sb doping effect on transport behavior in the topological insulator Bi2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is a good topological insulator (TI) with its surface band Dirac point inside the bulk bandgap. However, Bi2Se3 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) often require tuning of Fermi level near the Dirac point for optimal proximity effect with magnetic or superconducting materials. In this study, we achieve the control of the Fermi level in MBE-grown Bi2Se3 thin films by antimony (Sb) doping and systematically investigate the transport properties of these Bi2-xSbxSe3 films with different doping concentrations. Excellent topological surface conduction is attained, and weak antilocalization is observed in all Sb-doped Bi2Se3 films. While the carrier mobility shows no dependence on the Sb concentrations, indicating that the phonon scattering dominates over the impurity scattering from Sb dopants, the coherence length varies significantly with the Sb doping level at low temperatures (&lt; 30 K), highlighting the non-negligible electron-electron interactions in the low temperature regime. Furthermore, EuS/Bi2-xSbxSe3 heterostructures are fabricated to explore proximity-induced ferromagnetism in the TI surface states. However, the long-range magnetic order is not formed in the TI surface states under our growth conditions. Our results emphasize the critical role of interface quality for realizing exchange coupling. This work offers new insights into the interplay of disorder, decoherence, and scattering mechanisms in Sb-doped Bi2Se3 thin films, providing guidance for the future study of the proximity effect in heterostructures involving Sb-doped Bi2Se3.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear opto-magnetic signuature of d-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered collinear magnetic order with net zero magnetization but exhibits spin-splitting band structure, has attracted much research interest due to the rich fundamental physics and possible applications. In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the N\'eel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties.</description>

      <title>Controlling GaN nucleation via O$_2$-plasma-perforated graphene masks on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin, perforated graphene on $c$-plane sapphire functions as a nanoscale mask that enables GaN growth through thru-holes. We tune the perforated-area fraction $f_p$ by controlled O$_2$-plasma exposure and quantify its impact on early-stage nucleation: the nucleation-site density scales with $f_p$, while the nucleation-delay time decreases approximately as $1/f_p$. Time-resolved areal coverage and domain counts exhibit systematic $f_p$-dependent trends. A kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model that coarse-grains atomistic events -- adatom arrival, surface diffusion, attachment at exposed sapphire within perforations, and coalescence (the first front-front contact between laterally growing domains) -- reproduces these trends using a constant per-site nucleation rate. Fitting the kMC simulation data yields onset times t$_0$ for the nucleation delay that closely match independently observed no-growth thresholds (Set 1: 28.5s vs $\sim$30s; Set 2: 38s vs $\sim$35s), validating the kMC-experiment mapping and highlighting plasma dose as an activation threshold for plasma-induced through-hole formation in 2D materials. Together, experiment and kMC identify $f_p$ as a single, surface-engineerable parameter governing GaN nucleation statistics on perforated graphene masks, providing a quantitative basis and process window for epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG)/thru-hole epitaxy (THE) workflows that employ two-dimensional masks.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of terbium tellurides Tb2Te5 and TbTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two terbium tellurides, TbTe3 and Tb2Te5, were studied by means of thermodynamics, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and torque magnetometry. While crystal structure and some physical properties of TbTe3 were established previously, the crystal structure of Tb2Te5 was solved only in this work in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm with the parameters of unit cell a = 4.3120(5), b = 41.0305(76) and c = 4.2979(8) {\AA}. In contrast to TbTe3, which experiences three successive magnetic phase transitions, Tb2Te5 orders antiferromagnetically in two steps at TN1 = 9.0 K and TN2 = 6.8 K, both readily suppressed by an external magnetic field. The third transition in TbTe3 is due to the interaction of the magnetic subsystem with the charge density waves. The interaction of magnetic and electronic subsystems in Tb2Te5 has been revealed by the pump probe. Torque measurements of TbTe3 show that the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at high temperatures and switch to the b axis at low temperatures. In Tb2Te5, the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Phase-Transition Framework for Gate-Tunable Superconductivity in Monolayer WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported gate-tunable superconductivity in monolayer WTe$_2$ exhibits several striking anomalies beyond the standard paradigm, including a contrasting carrier-density dependence of the transition temperature $T_c$ in weakly and strongly disordered regimes and more surprisingly, the sudden disappearance of superconducting fluctuations below a critical carrier density. To understand these features, we go beyond the mean-field theory to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density by explicitly incorporating both Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase fluctuations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations are minimal in the weak-disorder regime but become crucial under strong disorder, where the zero-temperature gap renormalized by NG quantum fluctuations becomes density-dependent while the BKT fluctuations drive the superconducting $T_c$ below the gap-closing temperature. Simulations within this unified framework combining with the density-functional-theory input to account for the excitonic instability quantitatively reproduced nearly all key experimental observations in monolayer WTe$_2$, providing a consistent understanding of reported anomalies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spin Injection in Graphene via Dynamical Carrier Filtering at Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a real-time first-principles study of ultrafast spin injection in a WSe$_2$-graphene heterobilayer under circularly polarized laser irradiation, using time-dependent density functional theory. Contrary to conventional expectations, spin transfer into graphene is not a passive process but is actively driven by spin-selective carrier filtering at the interface. Spin-polarized carriers generated in the WSe$_2$ layer induce a preferential migration of opposite-spin carriers from graphene, which results in net spin magnetization in graphene. This process is governed by interlayer band offsets, density-of-state asymmetry, and Pauli blocking. These findings indicate a microscopic mechanism of spin injection in non-magnetic systems and identify a guiding principle for the design of ultrafast opto-spintronic functionalities in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent Charge Transfer and inter-layer coupling in WSe2/Graphene Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interfacial interactions in two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures is essential for advancing optoelectronic and quantum technologies. We investigate metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown WSe$_2$ films (one to five layers) on graphene/SiC, directly compared to exfoliated WSe$_2$ on SiO$_2$, using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy complemented by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman measurements reveal compressive strain and interfacial charge transfer in WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructures, evidenced by blue-shifted phonon modes and the emergence of higher-order interlayer breathing modes absent on SiO$_2$. Concomitant shifts and attenuation of graphene's G and 2D modes with increasing WSe$_2$ thickness indicate progressive p-type doping of graphene, while WSe$_2$ phonon shifts point to n-type doping of the semiconductor, consistent with interfacial electron transfer. PL shows strong quenching for monolayer WSe$_2$ on graphene due to ultrafast charge transfer and F"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), with partial emission recovery in multilayers relative to SiO$_2$-supported flakes. Exciton behavior differs strongly between substrates: on SiO$_2$, A- and B-exciton energies vary markedly with thickness, whereas on graphene they remain nearly pinned. This stability reflects the combined effects of graphene's strong dielectric screening and charge-transfer-induced free-carrier screening, with strain playing a secondary role. These results establish graphene, unlike SiO$_2$, as an active interfacial partner that stabilizes excitonic states and enables engineering of the optical response of 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Structure Exploration and Thermodynamics of Heteroatom Doped Graphene Superstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has been studied in detail due to its mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. It is well documented that the introduction of dopants or defects in the lattice can be used to tune material properties for a specific application, such as in electronics, sensors, or catalysis. To design graphene with specific properties, one must achieve control over the composition and concentration of defects. This requires a fundamental understanding of the stability of defects and their interaction in a superstructure. We present a comprehensive defect structure determination approach that enables close to exhaustive enumeration of all relevant defect structures. The approach uses a combination of Density Functional Theory and machine learning to build a transferable energy model for defect formation. Henceforth, we show the capabilities of our approach for a proof-of-principle application on free-standing graphene with heteroatom defects. This allows us to provide physical insights into defect interactions and to establish a thermodynamic model to investigate how temperature affects the configuration space of doped graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved magnets offer a rich phase diagram and hold great promise for next-generation spintronic technologies. This study establishes the paramount significance of high-order vortex states (e.g., 3$\varphi$ with winding number $n$ &gt; 1) in VSe2 nanotubes, which uniquely enable magnonic functionalities fundamentally inaccessible to conventional magnetic systems. These states arise from diameter-dependent competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic ($J_1$) and longer-range antiferromagnetic ($J_2$/$J_3$) couplings, as rigorously validated through density-functional theory calculations and Heisenberg modeling of phase diagrams. Critically, by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that high-order vortex configurations unlock an intrinsic hybridization mechanism governed by strict orbital angular momentum (OAM) selection rules ($\Delta l = \pm 2(n-1)$) -- a process strictly forbidden in fundamental vortices ($n$ = 1) -- generating complex high-OAM magnons with measurable topological charge. This is vividly demonstrated in the 3$\varphi$ state, where hybridization between $l$ = -4, 0 and 4 modes produces eight-petal magnon density patterns. Such states provide an essential platform-free solution for generating high-OAM magnons, wchich is crucial for spin-wave-based information transport. These findings establish a predictive theoretical framework for controlling high-order vortex states in curved magnets and highlight VSe2 nanotubes as a promising platform for exploring complex magnetism and developing future magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Terahertz nonlinear response in cuprate superconductors and the Higgs field in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A puzzling phenomenon has been recently revealed in terahertz nonlinear optical response experiments: A third harmonic generation (THG) signal, identified only in the superconducting (SC) phase in a conventional BCS superconductor, is found to persist into a wide pseudogap regime in the underdoped cuprate, accompanied by a $\pi$ phase shift in the THG signal across the SC transition. In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such an unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed holons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase (LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase coherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like responses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations described by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external electromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the SC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $\pi$ phase shift with a substantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in nickelate compounds has opened new avenues in the study of high-temperature superconductors. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the field, including all different nickelate systems, reduced-Ruddlesden-Popper-type infinite layer LaNiO$_2$, Ruddlesden-Popper-type bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We begin by introducing the superconducting properties of the hole-doped LaNiO$_2$ system, which marked the starting point for nickelate superconductivity. We then turn to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system, discussing both its high-pressure and thin-film superconducting phases. This is followed by an examination of the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ system and other related multilayer nickelates. Throughout the review, we highlight emerging trends, key challenges, and open questions. We conclude by addressing current limitations in materials synthesis and characterization, and future directions that may help uncover the mechanisms driving superconductivity in these complex oxide systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant current-in-plane spin-torque diode effect in magnet$-$normal metal bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Via the spin-Hall effect and its inverse, in-plane charge currents in a normal metal$-$ferromagnet (N$|$F) bilayer can be used to excite and detect magnetization dynamics in F. Using a magneto-electric circuit approach, we here consider the current response to quadratic order in the applied electric field, which is resonantly enhanced for driving frequencies close to frequencies of coherent magnetization modes. Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction electrons in F.</description>

      <title>Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2) nanoparticles. Enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes are observed as the nanoparticle edges are approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations by Chen et al (Nature Communications 12, 5007 (2021). Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explains the experimental observation by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need of full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. Noticeably, we introduce a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials using limited Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This approach effectively captures both covalent and van der Waals interactions, enabling accurate extrapolations of DFT calculations to larger systems with built-in error estimation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking CHGNet Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Against DFT and EXAFS: Case of Layered WS2 and MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) deliver near ab initio accuracy in energy and force calculations at low computational cost, making them invaluable for materials modeling. Although uMLIPs are pre-trained on vast ab initio datasets, rigorous validation remains essential for their ongoing adoption. In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (DFT) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ~100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning dataset sizes.</description>

      <title>Observation of tunable chiral spin textures with nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral spin textures, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, are key to advancing spintronics by enabling ultrathin, energy-efficient memory, and high-density data storage and processing. However, their realization remains hindered by the scarcity of suitable host materials and the formidable experimental challenges associated with the characterization of these intricate chiral magnetic states. Here, we report the observation of tunable chiral magnetic textures in van der Waals magnet CrPS$_4$ with nonlinear optics. These tunable textures exhibit strong chiral third-order nonlinear optical responses, driven by interlayer and intralayer spin couplings under varying magnetic fields and temperatures. These pronounced chiral nonlinear optical responses highlight the potency and high sensitivity of the nonlinear optical readout for probing non-collinear magnetic orders. Moreover, our findings position van der Waals magnets and their heterostructures as an exceptional platform for reconfigurable spin-photonics and spintronics, unifying optical, electrical, and magnetic properties through unique intralayer and interlayer spin coupling properties and effective spin interaction between photons and electrons.</description>

      <title>Persistent spin texture preserved by local symmetry in graphene/WTe$_2$ heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries in solids give rise to spin-momentum locking, which determines how an electron's spin orientation depends on its momentum. This relationship, often referred to as spin texture, influences both charge-to-spin conversion and spin relaxation, making it one of the essential characteristics for spin-orbit-driven phenomena. Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry can host persistent spin textures (PSTs) - unidirectional spin configurations in momentum space, supporting efficient charge-to-spin conversion and extended spin lifetimes. Monolayer WTe$_2$, a topological material crystallizing in a rectangular lattice, is a notable example; its symmetry enforces a canted PST enabling quantum spin Hall effect with the nontrivial spin orientation. Here, we use first-principles calculations to explore how these properties are modified when WTe$_2$ is interfaced with graphene. We find that the PST is preserved by the local symmetry present in different regions of the heterostructure, while the system develops extended electron and hole pockets, resulting in semimetallic behavior. Although the band gap closes and eliminates the quantum spin Hall phase, spin Hall effects remain robust in both conventional and unconventional geometries. The computed spin Hall conductivities are comparable to those of other two-dimensional materials, and the survival of the PST suggests the possibility of long-range spin transport even in the absence of topological edge states. In addition, the graphene layer serves as an oxidation barrier, helping protect the intrinsic properties of WTe$_2$ and supporting the potential of this heterostructure for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Weakly superconducting anisotropy in 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 with 1T/1H heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) exhibit rich physical properties by the combination of strong electronic correlation effects in 1T layer and superconductivity in 1H layer. But the limited number of bulk TMD materials with such heterostructures impedes the in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms behind these properties, as well as research on tuning of these properties. Here, we report a systematic study on physical properties of the 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 single crystals with 1T/1H heterostructure. It exhibits a superconducting transition at temperature below 3.3 K. Further analysis indicates that 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 is an intermediately coupled type-II superconductor. Moreover, 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 shows a rather weak superconducting anisotropy (~ 2), distinctly different from other known TMD superconductors with 4Hb heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.00761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the role of electronic correlations in different kinds of band insulators by using the two-orbital Hubbard model within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). An intriguing finding is that electronic correlations turn a metal into a band insulator when ionicity and covalency are equal in ratio.We conclude that the electronic correlations favour metallicity when the covalency is smaller than the ionicity, while they favour insulating behaviour when the covalency is greater than ionicity.</description>

      <title>Possible Sliding Regimes in Twisted Bilayer WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of increasingly one-dimensional (1D) behavior with decreasing temperature in small-angle twisted bilayers of WTe$_2$ (tWTe$_2$), we theoretically explore the exotic sliding regimes that could be realized in tWTe$_2$. At zero displacement field, while hole-doped tWTe$_2$ can be thought of as an array of weakly coupled conventional two-flavor 1D electron gases (1DEGs), the electron-doped regime is equivalent to coupled four-flavor 1DEGs , due to the presence of an additional "valley'' degree of freedom. In the decoupled limit, the electron-doped system can thus realize phases with a range of interesting ordering tendencies, including $4k_F$ charge-density-wave and charge-$4e$ superconductivity. Dimensional crossovers and cross-wire transport due to inter-wire couplings of various kinds are also discussed. We find that a sliding Luther-Emery liquid with small inter-wire couplings is probably most consistent with current experiments on hole-doped tWTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Strange metal at the Lifshitz transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strange metals are ubiquitously observed in a variety of strongly correlated materials, among which high temperature cuprates\cite{Greene2020} and twisted bilayer graphenes\cite{Cao2020} are the most prominent examples. The prevailing consensus is that the strange metal emerges within a finite temperature fan, mediated by a quantum critical point(QCP) where the pseudogap phase terminates\cite{keimer2015quantum,Michon2019}. A growing number of experiments\cite{Benhabib2015,DoironLeyraud2017,Horio2018} suggests that, in most cuprates, the QCP nearly coincides with a Lifshitz transition point. However, the nature of the QCP\cite{Zhu2022} and the significance of van Hove singularity(VHS) in driving quantum critical phenomena remain largely unexplored\cite{Horio2018,Shen2022}. Here we investigate quantum critical transport at Lifshitz transition in two dimensions(2D), where the Fermi surface geometry undergoes a convex-to-concave transition. The VHS saddle points is coupled to critical bosons via spatially uniform Yukawa interactions. At zero temperature, the interplay between extra scattering channel at Lifshitz transition and the impurity scattering gives rise to a linear-in-$\omega$ optical conductivity. At finite temperatures, we demonstrate a persistant linear-in-$T$ \emph{dc} resistivity in the quantum-critical temperature range down to $T\rightarrow 0$, which gives in to the saturation in non-universal higher temperature regime. For the spatially random Yukawa interaction, we show that the linear-in-$T$ resistivity unexpectedly extends even into the non-universal high-$T$ regime.</description>

      <title>Emergent dipole field theory in atomic ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of hard-core bosons on ladders, in the presence of strong kinetic constrains akin to those of the Bariev model. We use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations to establish the phase diagram of the model. The model displays a paired Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase featuring an emergent dipole symmetry, which encodes the local pairing constraint into a global, nonlocal quantity. We scrutinize the effect of such emergent low-energy symmetry during quench dynamics including single-particle defects. We observe that, despite being approximate, the dipole symmetry still leads to very slow relaxation dynamics, which we model via an effective field theory. The model we discuss is amenable to realization in both cold atoms in optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays with dynamics taking place solely in the Rydberg manifold. To observe the unusual dynamics of excitations in such experimental platforms, we propose a two-step protocol, which starts with the quasi-adiabatic preparation of low-energy states, followed by the local creation of defects and their study under quench dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The structural and electronic properties of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ clinopyroxene systems have been investigated by means of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements, performed at ISOLDE, combined with $ab-initio$ electronic structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The partial density of states (PDOS) of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and it has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$ potential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn $3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively. Combining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a supercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the Cd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline structures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a reduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing opportunities for potential band-gap engineering.</description>

      <title>Anomalous-Hall Neel textures in altermagnetic materials</title>

Abstract: Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of collinear antiferromagnet with nearly zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) on the N\'eel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the fundamental relationship between the AHE and the N\'eel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal all the unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the N\'eel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall N\'eel textures (AHNTs) for altermagnets. Specifically, we identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs for all altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the known spin textures in momentum space, and further reveal their symmetry origin. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work offers a thorough understanding of AHE in altermagnets and a complete and pictorial classification of altermagnets based on the geometry of response functions.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated Sn/Si monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated ground-state. From the spatial correlations of local density of states (LDOS) maps measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge between extended and localized states at the valence band-edge. Using theoretical analysis to explain the energy-dependent LDOS fluctuations, we estimate the system's conductivity change across this effective metal-insulator transition. Then, we compute the multifractal spectra of iso-energy LDOS maps and show that they follow an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) - the field theory of mesoscopic electronic systems. This observation suggests that NL$\sigma$Ms are valid even in a strongly correlated 2D system, down to conductivity levels as low as g ~ 0.1. We anticipate that the relation may be different in the chiral-superconducting phase reported for p-doped Sn/Si monolayer. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis could equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnon decay in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that magnons in two-dimensional altermagnets can spontaneously decay at zero temperature. The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetism and spin excitations in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson flux model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with non-reciprocal hoppings is a prominent example of a relatively simple non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical system, which allows to study various phenomena in open quantum systems without adding extra gain and loss terms. Here we propose to use it as a building block to construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has the characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal hopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we analyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin excitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which leads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry with exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from one region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction parameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze the spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of modes corresponding to gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</description>

      <title>Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals superconductors are attracting much attention owing to their rich phase diagrams including possible unconventional superconductivity. However, they suffer from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly Induced Transverse Planar Transport Phenomena in Three Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In f-electron materials like Pr or U compounds with non-Kramers states of the f-shell the ground state may be a nonmagnetic singlet due to the action of the crystalline electric field. Nevertheless these compounds can order magnetically. They develop a ground state moment and long range order due to the spontaneous admixture of the excited state into the ground state caused by inter-site exchange. This mechanism can establish magnetic order if a control parameter exceeds a critical value defining the quantum critical point between disordered and magnetic phase. Here we investigate the magnetocaloric properties of such quantum magnets where the entropy release at low temperature is due to a competition between thermal depopulation and spontaneous order effects. We determine field and temperature dependence of specific heat for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order and also calculate the adiabatic magneto- and barocaloric cooling rates. As a model application we discuss the magnetic specific heat of the new induced ferromagnet PrIr3. Furthermore we analyze the excitation spectrum of the singlet induced moment magnets in an external field with particular emphasis on field and temperature dependence of the critical soft mode. We find that the latter is fragile and exists only at specific points in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>How transparent is graphene? A surface science perspective on remote epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote epitaxy is the synthesis of a single crystalline film on a graphene-covered substrate, where the film adopts epitaxial registry to the substrate as if the graphene is transparent. Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We identify challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moir\'e epitaxy. We highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene, which are crucial for navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy. In light of this weak remote potential, we re-evaluate the current state-of-the-art experimental evidence, highlighting why it remains challenging to experimentally validate a ``remote'' epitaxy mechanism that cannot be explained by alternatives, such as pinhole-seeded epitaxy or serial van der Waals epitaxy. We end with one experimental example that, to out knowledge, cannot be explained by competing mechanisms: a different long-range epitaxial relationship for GdPtSb films grown on graphene/sapphire, compared to direct epitaxy on sapphire. We suggest for future experiments that directly measure the remote potential and impact of tunable growth kinetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory effects during metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel electronics mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in sequential non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as the full chain of transitions can involve features lasting anywhere from femtoseconds to microseconds. Here, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the dynamic range of timescales spanning 9 orders of magnitude to fully trace the pathways of photoexcited insulator-metal transition and the following relaxation through non-equilibrium metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a promising Mott material. We find 5 orders of magnitude variation in metal-insulator transition time, from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, depending on pre-excitation phase state. We provide a theoretical explanation and simulations based on strain feedback to domain nucleation. The lingering transition is stretched in time by memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity and, contrary to known memory effects in vanadium oxides commonly described by power laws, follows an extremely (factor below 0.2) stretched exponential. The induced dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system signifies unusually high heterogeneity of transition barriers similar to biological systems, and demonstrates importance of non-local correlations of structure in evolution of transitional phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Bosonization in $R$-paraparticle Luttinger models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of $R$-parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>An $ab\;initio$ answer to long-debated questions about superconducting Nb$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures, yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.</description>
