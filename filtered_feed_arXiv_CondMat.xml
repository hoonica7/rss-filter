      <title>Radiative Heat Transfer and 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Mediated Cross-Layer Pairing in Pressurized Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Probing Fermi surface topology by ultrafast pump pulse dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical approach to detect changes in Fermi surface topology in a two-band model. Specifically, we show that the system's response to a low intensity light pulse can precisely identify topological Lifshitz transitions. At a suitable frequency, the light resonantly couples valence and conduction electrons, leading to an oscillation in the interband coherence term. This, in turn, generate a persistent oscillatory current which survives even after the end of the pulse. Notably, the relative amplitude of the oscillatory current during the pulse with that of the post-pulse reaches a minimum when the Fermi energy aligns with the saddle point, providing a robust framework for dynamically identifying Lifshitz transitions.</description>

      <title>Efficient GW calculations for metals from an accurate ab initio polarizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its success in the study of spectroscopic properties, the $GW$ method presents specific methodological challenges when applied to systems with metallic screening. Here, we present an efficient and fully ab-initio implementation for the calculation of the screened potential, specifically designed for 3D and 2D metals. It combines a Monte Carlo integration with an appropriate interpolation of the screened potential between the calculated grid points (W-av), complemented with an extrapolation to the long-wavelength limit, able to seamlessly account for the so-called intraband term. This method greatly accelerates the convergence of GW calculations for metals while improving their accuracy, due to the correct description of the intraband transitions in the long wavelength limit, as shown here for 3D metals and doped monolayers, such as MoS$_2$ and graphene. The use of W-av results in an excellent agreement with ARPES measurements for monolayer doped MoS$_2$. Furthermore, for graphene we show that more robust results are found with the use of higher-order Lorentzians in the description of the self-energy, together with the solution of the QP equation beyond the linearized approximation.</description>

      <title>Optically Tunable Spin Transport in Bilayer Altermagnetic Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization, which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems via electric and optical means.</description>

      <title>Randomly twisted bilayer graphene -- the cascade transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is known to have disorder in its twist angle. We show that in terms of a Dirac equation with a random gauge potential ${\bf A}({\bf r})$ this disorder becomes huge when the average twist angle is near the magic angle where the Dirac velocity vanishes. The density of states (DOS) then diverges at the Dirac point as $\rho(E)\sim E^{(2/z)-1}$ with $z\gg 1$ and we deduce that all electrons occupy energies very near $E=0$. We prove a sum rule on the disorder averaged eigenfunctions from which we deduce that each added electron contributes equal intraband Coulomb interaction energy. The various bands in TBG are related by either ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow {\bf A}({-\bf r})$ or ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow -{\bf A}({\bf r})$ which affects the interband interaction energy. We find, within Hartree-Fock, jumps in the chemical potential at each integer filling, accounting for the cascade transitions.</description>

      <title>Giant spin Hall effects and topological surface states in ternary-layered MAX carbides Mn+1AlCn (M= Nb, Ta, n=1, 2, 3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report a systematic study of the electronic structures, band topology, and intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) of the layered MAX carbides Mn+1AlCn (M= Nb, Ta, n=1, 2, 3) and explore the correlation effects on the SHE. The results show that M3AlC2 and M4AlC3 (M= Nb, Ta) share similar Dirac-band-crossing features near the Fermi level (EF) and form nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). When the SOC is included, the Dirac band crossings are fully gapped, resulting in nontrivial Z2 topological invariants (1;000) with a pair of surface states on the (001) plane. Remarkably, the multiple gapped Dirac points contribute to locally strong spin Berry curvatures, which lead to large spin Hall conductivities and a giant spin Hall angle up to ~ 60% for Ta3AlC2. Moreover, we also elucidate the impact of Hubbard U correction on SHC. Our findings indicate that Ta3AlC2 might represent an intriguing layered Z2 topological metal with superior charge-to-spin conversion efficiency.</description>

      <title>Wannier Center Analysis on Possible Three-Dimensional Topological Phases in \alpha-Type Layered Organic Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered \alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3, a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be realized.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Observation of gapless collective charge fluctuations in an Anderson insulating state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization. However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge carriers: thermally activated transport ($T&gt;150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with Coulomb gap formation ($T&lt;50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, $(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field, indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.</description>

      <title>On the N\'eel Vector Dependence of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependence of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism on the experimental geometry is described by a frequency-dependent Hall vector. Using group theory, we derive a general relationship between the Hall vector and the orientation of the N\'eel vector $\bL$ in altermagnets within the free valence spin (FVS) approximation, where the spin-orbit coupling of the valence electrons and their exchange interaction with the core electrons are neglected. For a given spin point group, the full $\bL$-dependence of the Hall vector can be expressed in terms of several irreducible spectral functions. This derivation generalizes earlier results for the special cases of MnTe and MnF$_2$. Depending on the system symmetry, XMCD in the FVS approximation may be present, emerge only when the neglected terms are included, or be completely forbidden.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of the Topologically Nontrivial Phase in Monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free-standing monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$ (ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$) has been theoretically predicted to host a room-temperature quantum spin Hall phase. However, its experimental realization remains challenge due to the absence of a three-dimensional counterpart. Here, we demonstrate that HfTe$_2$ serves as an ideal substrate for the epitaxial growth of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, preserving its topological phase. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy confirm a strain-free ${(1 \times 1)}$ lattice of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, along with a sizable band gap, which is well captured by first-principles calculations. Moreover, distinct edge states, independent of step geometry and exhibiting a broad spatial distribution, are observed at ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$ step edges, underscoring its topological nature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced Quantum Metric Dipole in Dirac Semimetal Cd3As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometry, comprising Berry curvature and quantum metric, plays a fundamental role in governing electron transport phenomena in solids. Recent studies show that the quantum metric dipole drives scattering-free nonlinear Hall effect in topological antiferromagnets, prompting the questions of whether this effect can occur in nonmagnetic systems and be externally tuned by a magnetic field. Our work addresses these frontiers by demonstrating that the quantum metric dipole is actively tuned by an external magnetic field to generate a time-reversal-odd nonlinear Hall response in a nonmagnetic topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Alongside the well-known chiral-anomaly-induced negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, an exotic nonlinear planar Hall effect emerges with increasing magnetic field. Careful scaling analysis indicates that this nonlinear planar Hall effect is controlled by the magnetic-field-modulated quantum metric dipole. Constructing a k.p effective model of the Dirac bands under Zeeman and orbital coupling, we derive the evolution of the quantum metric dipole as a function of the magnetic field, providing a comprehensive explanation of the experimental results. Our results establish a band-structure-based strategy for engineering nonlinear magnetotransport in nonmagnetic materials via the quantum metric dipole, opening a pathway toward magnetic-field-tunable nonlinear quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Chern band in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with internal symmetries such as SU($N$) have so far been realized only in highly engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. Our findings unveil a new class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.</description>

      <title>Insulator-bad metal transition in RNiO$_3$ nickelates beyond Hubbard model and density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulator-bad metal transition observed in the Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth or yttrium Y) is considered to be a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of the Hubbard $U$-$t$-model and the density functional theory. However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet (S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases, high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin value for NiO$_6$ centers. Model $T$-R phase diagram reproduces main features of the phase diagram found for RNiO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric-gate Mach--Zehnder interferometry in graphene: Multi-path conductance oscillations and visibility characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations. We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structure of a nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper, we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements, coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe, exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX, electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its maximum along the GM direction.</description>

      <title>Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking perturbations in the Jahn-Teller-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of symmetry-breaking perturbations in the multiorbital Hubbard model coupled to anisotropic Jahn-Teller phonons, which is relevant for the description of fulleride superconductors. This system is often approximated by a model with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) Hund's coupling, in which the coupling to the Jahn-Teller phonon is effectively described, but the retardation effect associated with phonon propagation is neglected. We compare the properties of the models with static AFM Hund's coupling and dynamical Jahn-Teller electron-phonon interaction by means of the Eliashberg theory. Considering the susceptibilities for the spin, magnetic orbital, electric orbital, and superconductivity, we reveal a qualitatively different behavior between the two models in the case of the magnetic orbital susceptibility. We further study the effect of a magnetic field on the $s$-wave spin-singlet superconducting state. In the presence of the field, the magnetic orbital susceptibility becomes nonzero due to a combination of multiorbital and retardation effects, while the spin susceptibility remains zero at low temperatures. By analyzing this phenomenon both numerically and analytically, we clarify that odd-frequency pairs induced by the magnetic field play a crucial role in the spin and orbital magnetic susceptibilities. Thus, the magnetic degrees of freedom produce interesting behaviors in the presence of retardation effects associated with electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Field-Tailoring Quantum Materials: Magneto-Synthesis of Metastable Metallic States in a Spin-Orbit-Coupled Trimer Iridate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Tunable Interfacial Thermal Conductance in Graphene/Germanene van der Waals Heterostructure using an Optimized Interlayer Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value. Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.</description>

      <title>Breakdown and polarization contrasts in ferroelectric devices observed by operando laser-based photoemission electron microscopy with the AC/DC electrical characterization system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an operando laser-based photoemission electron microscope (laser-PEEM) with a ferroelectric characterization system. A Sawyer-Tower circuit was implemented to measure the polarization-voltage ($P-V$) characteristics of ferroelectric devices. Using this system, we successfully obtained the well-defined $P-V$ hysteresis loops for a ferroelectric capacitor incorporating Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO), reproducing the typical field-cycling characteristics of HZO capacitors. After dielectric breakdown caused by field-cycling stress, we visualized a conduction filament through the top electrode without any destructive processing. Additionally, we successfully observed polarization contrast through the top electrode of an oxide semiconductor (InZnO$_x$). These results indicate that our operando laser-PEEM system is a powerful tool for visualizing conduction filaments after dielectric breakdown, the ferroelectric polarization contrasts, and electronic state distribution of materials implemented in ferroelectric devices, including ferroelectric field-effect transistors and ferroelectric tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Doping $S=1$ antiferromagnet in one-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the limit of strong interactions, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.4$. A detailed analysis of interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case -- namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$. Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin, retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.</description>

      <title>Gate tunable spin-charge interconversion in a graphene/ReS$_{2}$ heterostructure up to room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the validity of the Cutler-Mott relations outside the Landau Fermi-liquid concept. We consider a two-site charge Kondo circuit as a paradigmatic example of a system possessing both Fermi- and non-Fermi liquid properties. It is shown that the generalized Cutler-Mott-like relations derived in the paper hold in both operating regimes of the charge Kondo quantum circuit describing a smooth crossover between low- and high- temperature regimes. We discuss applicability of the generalized Cutler-Mott relations for computing a figure of merit of the non-Fermi liquid quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Gradient Electronic Landscapes in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Terahertz range polarization rotation in the candidate time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor BiNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the observation of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconductivity in a BiNi bilayer using terahertz (THz) polarimetry. Leveraging a novel high-precision THz polarimetry technique, we detect, in the superconducting state and at zero magnetic field, the smallest polarization rotation of THz light measured to date. By using the MgO substrate itself as an optical resonator, we can reference the Faraday and Kerr rotations to each other. We observe a low-frequency Kerr rotation on the order of several hundred microradians in the superconducting phase, a clear signature consistent with TRS-breaking superconductivity. Our measurements enable direct access to the THz-range Hall conductivity. Through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, we link these low-energy measurements to prior high-frequency magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) data. This connection provides critical insight into the nature of the TRS-breaking state, supporting a multiband superconducting scenario over a disordered single-band interpretation for the origin of the Kerr effect.</description>

      <title>Straintronics across Lieb-Kagome interconversion and variable transport scaling exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel protocol of low-temperature, strain-tuned re-entrant metal-insulator transition and crossover between strongly correlated line-graph lattices (Lieb and Kagome). Using a non-perturbative numerical approach, we demonstrate for the first time that an applied shear strain stabilizes a metallic phase cradled in between a gapped magnetic insulator and a gapless flat band localized insulator, facilitating the Lieb/Kagome interconversion. Our results on transport signatures exhibit variable scaling exponents for electrical resistivity and optical conductivity, providing clear evidence of non-Fermi liquid physics. We also define a strain-dependent thermal scale to quantify the crossover between the non-Fermi liquid and bad metal phases.</description>

      <title>Readout of multi-level quantum geometry from electronic transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of a quantum system in a given parameter space captures both the geometry of the state manifold and the topology of the system. While the local QGT elements have been successfully measured in various platforms, the challenge of detecting them in electronic transport systems - such as tunnel or molecular junctions - has yet to be resolved. To fill this gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.</description>

      <title>High-density and scalable graphene Hall sensor arrays through monolithic CMOS integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs) offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS systems.</description>

      <title>Robust d-wave superconductivity from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model: possible route to high-temperature superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing numerical studies showed that the simplest Hubbard model on the square lattice with strong repulsion may not exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC). It is desired to look for other possible microscopic mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generate effective antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$, we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ with a moderate critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A15 Phase Ta3Sb Thin Films: Direct Synthesis, Charge Transport and Spin-Orbit Torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ta3Sb is one of the A15 compounds that have been predicted to have giant spin Hall conductivities due to the gapped Dirac-like band crossings in their electronic structures. We use co-sputtering to directly synthesize thin films of Ta3Sb and identify a large window of Ta:Sb flux ratio that permits the formation of single-phase A15 structure. These sputtered films have an actual Ta:Sb atomic ratio of 4:1 as determined from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Their high resistivity, at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, suggests that the electron mean free path is comparable to interatomic distances. From harmonic Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity of thin film Ta3Sb is estimated to be in the range of -526 to -1230 (hbar/e) S/cm at 300 K, lower in magnitude than the predicted value of -1400 (hbar/e) S/cm. First-principles calculations of the electronic structure show that the discrepancy is consistent with an increase of the Fermi level due to the non-ideal stoichiometry needed to stabilize the A15 structure.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shift and optical vorticity in the steady photovoltaic current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08596v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Advantage of the Correlated Exciton State in Non-linear Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of quantum geometry for single-particle states has revolutionized our interpretation of several emergent properties in condensed matter. However, a description of the quantum geometry for interacting particles and an understanding of its implications are lacking. Here, we show that inherent in the non-linear optical response is a quantum geometry of the correlated electron-hole state (exciton) that arises from the interplay between geometry and interactions - distinct from the quantum geometric properties of the individual electron or hole states. We demonstrate using first principles calculations that this quantum many-body geometry significantly enhances the non-linear optical response in systems with strong excitonic effects. In the case of shift currents, the quantum many-body geometric term arises in the many-body shift vector and can be interpreted as a many-body analogue of the Berry phase. This work lays the foundation to study the quantum geometry of correlated states in experimentally observable settings.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Non-Fermi Liquid and Dynamical Planckian Scaling of a Quasi-Kagome Kondo Lattice System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the quantum critical point of correlated materials, a non-Fermi liquid state appears where electron correlations continuously develop to very low temperatures. The relaxation time of the interacted electrons, namely quasiparticles, is scaled with the Planckian time, $\hbar/k_{\rm B}T$. However, there is a debate over whether heavy-fermion systems can obey the Planckian time. In the optical conductivity spectra, the Drude response will appear as the scaling of $\hbar\omega/k_{\rm B}T$ as the dynamical Planckian scaling (DPS). Here, we report the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the Drude response of a candidate for such materials, the quasi-kagome Kondo lattice CeRhSn. Even though the material shows a strong valence fluctuation, renormalized Drude responses observed at the photon energy below 100 meV are characterized by non-Fermi-liquid-like scattering rate $1/\tau$. The heavy carriers' Drude response only for the Ce quasi-kagome plane obeyed DPS below 80 K, suggesting the anisotropic quantum criticality with the strong $c \textrm{-} f$ hybridization.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single material. These include charge density waves, nematic phases, superconducting phases, and pair density waves. In this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be transitioned into the superconducting state by applying and subsequently removing a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is possibly a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.</description>

      <title>Low-energy optical absorption in correlated insulators: Projected sum rules and the role of quantum geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of a variety of correlated insulators in the moir\'e universe, controlled by interactions projected to a set of isolated bands with a narrow bandwidth, we examine here a partial sum-rule associated with the inverse frequency-weighted optical conductivity restricted to low-energies. Unlike standard sum-rules that extend out to $infinite$ frequencies, which include contributions from $all$ inter-band transitions, we focus here on transitions associated $only$ with the $projected$ degrees of freedom. We analyze the partial sum-rule in a non-perturbative but "solvable" limit for a variety of correlation-induced insulators. This includes (i) magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene at integer-filling with projected Coulomb interactions, starting from the chiral flat-band limit and including realistic perturbations, (ii) fractional fillings of Chern-bands which support generalized Laughlin-like states, starting from a Landau-level and including a periodic potential and magnetic-field, respectively, drawing connections to twisted MoTe$_2$, and (iii) integer filling in toy-models of non-topological flat-bands with a tunable quantum geometry in the presence of repulsive interactions. The partial sum-rule in all of these examples is implicitly constrained by the form of the band quantum geometry via the low-lying excitation spectrum, but is not related to it explicitly. For interacting Slater-determinant insulators, the partial sum-rule is related to a new quantity -- "many-body projected quantum geometry" -- obtained from the interaction-renormalized electronic bands. We also point out an intriguing connection between the partial sum-rule and the quantum Fisher information associated with the projected many-body position operator.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net charge carriers emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the transport variables in hydrodynamic domain. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature and Lorenz number $L_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}$. The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is expected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by examining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our findings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio consistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is attributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per net charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density, violate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene at a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high carrier density. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of quark-gluon plasma at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic Matter and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.</description>

Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO3 single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along c-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition TSR from phase {\Gamma}4 to {\Gamma}2. Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed. The magneto-structural effects were observed.</description>

      <title>Atomic Altermagnetism</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a N\'eel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear N\'eel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42{\deg} and 26{\deg} respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered N\'eel order of local dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</description>

      <title>Large strain contribution to the laser-driven magnetization response of magnetostrictive TbFe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate strain-induced contributions to the transient polar magneto-optical Kerr effect response in laser-excited terfenol. The tr-MOKE signals obtained from TbFe$_{2}$ films with and without glass capping exhibit distinct signatures associated with transient strain. We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump-probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response, but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Inverse Lieb Materials: Altermagnetism and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large N\'eel temperature ($\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Resource-optimized fault-tolerant simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model and high-temperature superconductor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring low-cost applications is paramount to creating value in early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>
