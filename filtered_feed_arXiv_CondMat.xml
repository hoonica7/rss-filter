      <title>Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>When Does a Single Repulsive Dirac Cone Superconduct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in a single two-dimensional Dirac cone offers a natural route to topological superconductivity. While usually considered extrinsic -- arising from proximity to a conventional superconductor -- we investigate when a doped Dirac cone can spontaneously develop superconductivity from a short-range repulsive interaction $U$ via the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism. We show that an ideal, linear Dirac cone is immune to pairing at leading order in $U^2$. Superconductivity instead emerges only through higher-order in $k$ corrections to the dispersion, which are unavoidable in any lattice realization and crucially dictate the pairing symmetry. The form of the pairing thus reflects how the well-known obstruction to realizing a single Dirac cone on a lattice is circumvented. When a Dirac cone arises from broken time-reversal symmetry -- for instance, at a transition between Chern insulators or in a valley-polarized phase -- we find a topological $p - ip$ state whose chirality is opposite to that of the parent chiral metal above $T_c$. By contrast, for a surface Dirac cone of a 3D topological insulator, superconductivity is stabilized by anisotropies in the dispersion. For $C_{3v}$-symmetric warping, as in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}$, pairing is strongest when the Fermi surface becomes hexagonal, leading to order in the $(d \pm id)\times(p+ip)$ channel with accidental near-nodes. In the highly anisotropic limit $v_x \gg v_y$, relevant to side surfaces of layered materials, the Fermi surface splits into two branches, and nesting favors a pairing symmetry $\Delta \sim \mathrm{sgn}(k_x)\cos(k_y)$ reminiscent of organic superconductors.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charge density wave fluctuations in the absence of long-range order in a hole-doped kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a complex interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In this study, we use ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy to probe the evolution of CDW order in hole-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ across a broad range of compositions ($0 \leq x \leq 0.68$). While thermodynamic and diffraction measurements show long-range CDW order vanishes above $x \approx 0.05$, we observe persistent signatures of CDW fluctuations up to the highest doping levels, with correlation times on the order of several picoseconds. These results indicate the presence of robust fluctuating charge order that survives well beyond the established CDW phase boundary. Furthermore, these fluctuations are enhanced near a doping-tuned quantum phase transition at $x^* \approx 0.15$, which coincides with a local minimum in the superconducting $T_\mathrm{c}$ double-dome. Additional measurements on Ti- and K-substituted samples confirm that this behavior is intrinsic to hole doping and not tied to disorder. Overall, our findings suggest that CDW fluctuations play a central role in the electronic phase diagram of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and may mediate or compete with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Engineering Hubbard models with gated two-dimensional moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moir\'e systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moir\'e potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moir\'e potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moir\'e potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moir\'e systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</description>

      <title>Deterministic N'eel vector switching of altermagnets via magnetic multipole torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as promising materials for next-generation spintronic devices. For their device applications, realizing a single-domain configuration is essential but remains challenging. We theoretically consider injecting magnetic multipoles into altermagnets, which can be achieved by applying an in-plane current to an altermagnet/normal metal bilayer. We demonstrate for $d$-wave altermagnets that the torque generated by the magnetic octupole injection can achieve magnetic-field-free deterministic switching of the altermagnets' N\'eel vector and transform their multidomain configurations into a single domain. This method allows the switching in diverse altermagnets, thereby facilitating their device applications and fundamental studies. This work also exemplifies the usefulness of magnetic multipole currents.</description>

      <title>Unravelling disorder in kagome Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of phonon instabilities that leads to the formation of charge modulated states in kagome metals has allowed their classification based on the atomic displacements. Here, we use diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering, backed by Monte Carlo simulations to describe a type-I instability in the kagome metal Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$. We find that the in-plane distortion of Co in the kagome plane drives a structural transition with the appearance of new Bragg peaks at odd $L$, which are surrounded by a hexagonal diffuse signal. The anisotropic diffuse scattering, characteristic of a highly frustrated triangular lattice was simulated following a combination of Ising hamiltonian and Lennard-Jones potential, and demonstrate that the structural phase transition in Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$ is of an order-disorder transformation type. The inelastic spectra reveals no softening but an anomalous broadening of the $\Gamma-A$ low energy acoustic mode. Our results highlight the critical role of the geometric frustration in promoting ordering from disorder in kagome lattices and power of diffuse scattering to disentangle the internal atomic displacements and correlated disorder.</description>

      <title>Evidence for single variant in altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism presents intriguing possibilities for spintronic devices due to its unique combination of strong spin-splitting and zero net magnetization. However, realizing its full potential hinges on fabricating single-variant altermagnetic thin films. In this work, we present definitive evidence for the formation of single-variant altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films with fully epitaxial growth on Al2O3(1-102) r-plane substrates, confirmed through rigorous structural analyses using X-ray diffraction, atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism. The mutual correspondence of the occupancy of oxygen atoms on the surfaces of RuO2(101)[010] and Al2O3(1-102)[11-20] plays a decisive role in the formation of the single-variant RuO2, which is also supported by our first-principles density functional theory calculations. We further observed spin-splitting magnetoresistance in the single-variant RuO2(101)/CoFeB bilayers, highlighting the characteristic effect of single variant on spin transport. The demonstration of single-variant RuO2(101) films marks a significant advancement in the field of altermagnetism and paves the way for exploring their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic brightening of light-like excitons in a monolayer semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as WSe$_2$, are direct gap, multi-valley semiconductors. Long-range electron-hole exchange interactions mix the valleys, yielding dispersion relations for massive ($\propto Q^2$) as well as light-like ($\propto Q$) excitons. We report magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons in the monolayer semiconductor WSe$_2$ to $B = \pm25$T. The magnetic field-dependent line shape of the neutral exciton reveals the emergence of a new blue-detuned emission peak in both field orientations. Analyzing the distinct magnetic field-dependent shifts of both peaks facilitates the identification of the emergent feature as a spin-singlet with a significantly smaller reduced exciton mass as compared to the neutral exciton. The intensity of the emergent feature increases with magnetic field according to $\propto B^2$, as expected for a linear dispersion relation. The density-dependent diamagnetic shift ratios of both features follow the expected density dependence of the electron-hole exchange interactions. We interpret our observations within a picture of magnetic-field-induced coupling between the bright massive and quasi dark light-like exciton, leading to its brightening.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the self energy and Eliashberg function from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy using the \textsc{xARPES} code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for studying anisotropic many-body interactions through the electron spectral function. Existing attempts to decompose the spectral function into non-interacting dispersions and electron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-impurity self-energies rely on linearization of the bands and manual assignment of self-energy magnitudes. Here, we show how self-energies can be extracted consistently for curved dispersions. We extend the maximum-entropy method to Eliashberg-function extraction with Bayesian inference, optimizing the parameters describing the dispersions and the magnitudes of electron-electron and electron-impurity interactions. We compare these novel methodologies with state-of-the-art approaches on model data, then demonstrate their applicability with two high-quality experimental data sets. With the first set, we identify the phonon modes of a two-dimensional electron liquid on TiO$_2$-terminated SrTiO$_3$. With the second set, we obtain unprecedented agreement between two Eliashberg functions of Li-doped graphene extracted from separate dispersions. We release these functionalities in the novel Python code \textsc{xARPES}.</description>

      <title>Order-Disorder Transitions and Thermal Pathways in Frustrated 2D Colloidal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ extensive NPT molecular dynamics simulations to explore the thermal transitions of two-dimensional colloidal crystals interacting via a core-softened potential with competing length scales. The system stabilizes three distinct solid phases, namely low-density triangular (LDT), stripe, and kagome, which exhibit markedly different responses to heating and cooling. Our simulations reveal that the LDT and kagome phases melt via first-order transitions, but only the former recrystallizes smoothly. The kagome phase displays strong hysteresis and metastability, while the stripe phase undergoes a continuous and nearly reversible transformation. These results highlight the role of lattice geometry and frustration in shaping non-universal melting and freezing pathways in 2D soft matter.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Frustration Modulation in $\kappa$-type Quantum Spin Liquid Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key parameter controlling electronic and magnetic properties of quantum spin liquid systems, yet remains challenging to tune. Here, we coherently drive molecular vibrations with midinfrared pulses in two organic quantum spin liquid candidates, the insulating $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ and the metallic $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$, and probe their electronic response through ultrafast reflectivity measurements. We observe a nonlinear coupling between local molecular vibrations and nonlocal phonons, which is expected to directly modulate the geometric frustration of their triangular lattice. Our findings establish a promising route to dynamically control frustration in nonbipartite quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Visible-Light Photocatalytic Degradation of Cresols using Sustainable 3D-Printed Bi4O5I2-Hematite Scaffold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In photocatalysis, the reusability limit of catalysts can contribute to secondary pollution, posing ecological risks. Addressing this, the present study explores the integration of additive manufacturing with photocatalysis by decorating Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ onto a 3D-printed hematite scaffold (Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$@3DH) for the degradation of cresols. The 3D-printed hematite grid, fabricated via direct ink writing, exhibited excellent rheological behavior ($\tau\gamma = 24$ Pa), allowing precise shape retention. The sintered Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ was subsequently immobilized via a facile dip-coating method. Under optimized conditions, the composite achieved 99.78\% degradation of 20 mg/L p-cresol within 240 min of irradiation. Notably, hematite served as a porous substrate and contributed to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory simulations with Hubbard correction (DFT+U) indicated an interfacial charge transfer of approximately -0.9 electrons from hematite to Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$, confirming a S-scheme heterojunction between hematite and Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ semiconductors, validating experimental observations. The composite demonstrated strong performance across varied water matrices and in the presence of other cresol isomers. It also retained 84.28\% degradation efficiency after 10 cycles, with negligible catalyst leaching. Furthermore, in vitro and in silico ecotoxicity analyses revealed reduced toxicity of the degradation products. The current work presents a novel and scalable strategy, advancing the use of earth-abundant hematite minerals in sustainable environmental remediation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated to elucidate the nature of quantum phases and their criticality when entangled with a correlated quantum bath, we study interacting bosons on a "comb lattice" -- a one-dimensional backbone (system) coupled at its sites to otherwise independent one-dimensional "teeth" chains (bath). We map out the corresponding phase diagram, detailing the nature of the phases and phase transitions. Controlled by the backbone and teeth hopping amplitudes, on-site interaction and chemical potential, phases include a Mott-insulator (MI), backbone (LLb) and teeth (LLp) Luttinger liquids, and the long-range ordered incoherent superfluid (iSF). We explore their properties and potential realizations in condensed matter and cold-atom experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting LaMnO3: A density functional theory study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal Coulomb interactions. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.</description>

      <title>Light-induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnetic CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of semiconducting antiferromagnetic CrSBr using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. In zero magnetic field, laser excitation modifies only the magnetization along the easy axis, leaving transverse components unaffected. We find that below-gap, low-fluence pulses enhance the local magnetic moments via spin transfer from nonmagnetic to magnetic atoms, increasing the Neel vector. In contrast, high-fluence pulses drive interlayer spin transfer between magnetic atoms, producing strong demagnetization and reducing the Neel vector, while S and Br atoms exhibit primarily charge transfer with weak opposite contribution to the demagnetization. An applied magnetic field qualitatively alters the response, enabling both magnitude changes and ultrafast reorientation of the magnetization. We show that the resulting layer-resolved reorientation respects a twofold rotation about the x-axis, exciting coherent optical magnons even under this symmetry, which modulate the relative angle between neighboring layers and periodically tune electronic properties. These results reveal a microscopic pathway for coherent magnon excitation in van der Waals magnets and establish a framework for controlling their coupled spin-charge dynamics on femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Universal relations between thermoelectrics and noise in mesoscopic transport across a tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for currents and noise in transport experiments. Our findings uncover a set of universal transport relations between thermoelectric and noise properties of a system probed through a tunnel contact, with the Wiedemann-Franz law being just one example of such universality between charge and heat currents. We apply this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo, quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.</description>

      <title>Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Edgetronics in 2D Altermagnet via Real-Space-Spin Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Bulk photovoltaic effects in the Haldane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.</description>
