      <title>Lessons from $\alpha$-RuCl3 for pursuing quantum spin liquid physics in atomically thin materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $\alpha$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $\alpha$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $\alpha$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $\alpha$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $\alpha$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Universal negative magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic metals caused by symmetry breaking of electron wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals crystals of topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe2As2, EuSn2As2, EuSn2P2, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about 5% up to the spin-polarization field. Although this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. Here, we propose a theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that is inherent in AFM metals and is based on violation the binary T2 symmetry. It is almost isotropic to the field and current directions, contrary to the known mechanisms such as giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly. The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of the layered AFM-ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the structural and electronic properties of niobium nitride (NbN) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on c-plane sapphire with miscut angles of $0.5^\text{o}$, $2^\text{o}$, $4^\text{o}$, and $10^\text{o}$ towards m-axis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans reveal that the full width at half maximum of the rocking curves around the 1 1 1 reflection of these NbN films decreases with increasing miscut. Starting from 76 arcsecs on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut, the FWHM reduces to almost 20 arcsecs on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire indicating improved structural quality. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images indicate that NbN on c-sapphire has around 10 nm critical thickness, irrespective of the substrate miscut, above which it turns columnar. The improved structural property is correlated with a marginal increment in superconducting transition temperature $T_\text{c}$ from 12.1 K for NbN on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire to 12.5 K for NbN on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire.</description>

      <title>Screw-dislocation-engineered quantum dot: geometry-tunable nonlinear optics, orbital qubit addressability, and torsion metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced B1 to B2 Phase Transition in CeN Studied by ab initio Correlation Matrix Renormalization Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure. For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of entanglement asymmetry for space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement asymmetry for the space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with an on-site energy imbalance between the two sublattices. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction.</description>

      <title>Topological transition induced by selective random defects on a honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the spectral and topological properties of electron systems evolve on a lattice that interpolates between the honeycomb and its 1/6-depleted structures through the introduction of selective random defects. We find that in certain parameter regimes, the topological properties of the two lattice systems are smoothly connected, whereas in other regimes, selective random defects induce a topological transition. Analysis based on an effective model reveals that the effect of selective random defects can be understood as a modulation of hopping amplitudes. Our results highlight the potential for designing and controlling the spectral and even topological properties of electronic systems across a wide range of material platforms.</description>

      <title>Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Heat Capacity of Thermally Reduced Graphene Oxide: Compaction and Thermal Annealing Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature heat capacity of thermally reduced graphene oxide (trGO) as a function of compaction pressure and annealing temperature. Graphene oxide was synthesized using a modified Hummers method and subsequently thermally reduced at 300\,{\deg}C, 500\,{\deg}C, and 700\,{\deg}C under vacuum to systematically vary the oxygen content and structural ordering. The specific heat data in the 2--300\,K range reveal that the thermal response is governed by phonons, including contributions from a Schottky-type anomaly, a defect-related linear term, a Debye term, and a dispersive term with a negative coefficient associated with out-of-plane flexural (ZA) phonons. Increasing compaction pressure alters interlayer coupling and leads to non-monotonic changes in heat capacity, while higher annealing temperatures enhance graphitization, reduce disorder, and modify phonon dispersion. The absence of a boson peak -- similar to that observed in carbon nanotubes -- supports the dominance of two-dimensional vibrational modes. These findings elucidate the relationship between dimensionality, structural disorder, and processing parameters in shaping the phonon dynamics of trGO, providing guidance for tailoring its thermal behavior in advanced carbon-based functional materials.</description>

      <title>Stability of current-carrying states in hard-core bosons with long-range hopping on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of current-carrying states with quasi-momentum $K$ in the Bose-condensed phase of the hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice, where particles transfer between two sites separated by distance $r$ with hopping amplitude decaying algebraically with $r$ as $\propto r^{-\alpha}$. Using a mean-field theory, we analyze the excitation spectrum and determine the critical quasi-momenta associated with Landau and dynamical instabilities. We find that the long-range hopping suppresses the critical quasi-momenta and makes them vanish at $\alpha=3$. Near $\alpha=3$, we show that the critical quasi-momentum $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the dynamical instability exhibits the scaling behavior $K_\mathrm{c} \propto \Delta^{1+\Delta}$ with $\Delta=\alpha-3$, where the scaling exponent explicitly depends on $\Delta$, as a consequence of the long-range nature of the hopping.</description>

      <title>Observation of the surface hybridization gap in the electrical transport properties of the ultrathin topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ in its ultrathin limit i.e. when the thickness is of the same order as the surface state penetration depth. It is expected that in this limit a hybridization gap opens at the Dirac point, which gives rise to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) or insulating phase, depending on the material thickness. We fabricate (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Hall bars with a thicknesses of 6 and 9 nm and measure an insulating phase around the Dirac point for low bias and at sub-Kelvin temperatures only in samples fabricated from the 6 nm films, which indicates the presence of a hybridization gap. The effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on the hybridization gap is studied but remains partially unresolved. The results form an important step towards experimentally realizing the quantum spin Hall state via hybridization in ultrathin films of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, yet, they also expose a knowledge gap regarding transport measurements in these systems.</description>

      <title>Composition-Dependent Properties of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ Nanopowders Tailored for X-Ray Photodynamic Therapy and Cathodoluminescence Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Neural network impurity solver for real-frequency dynamical mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a neural network impurity solver for real-frequency DMFT that employs a multihead cross-attention mechanism to map hybridization functions to spectral functions, conditioned on impurity parameters. Trained on high-quality MPS data from complex contour time evolution and incorporating derivative constraints with respect to the complex-time angle, our model achieves smooth generalization to the real-frequency axis. Benchmarking on the single-band Hubbard model for the Bethe lattice demonstrates quantitative accuracy across metallic, strongly correlated, and insulating regimes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced transition in heat conduction through a topological metamaterial of rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of rigid rotors. The rotors are constrained to rotate in a plane about fixed pivot points and coupled by springs, such that in equilibrium, the neighboring rotors lie on opposite sides of the chain axis. The linearized limit of this model valid for small angular displacements, was first introduced by Kane and Lubensky (KL) as a topological mechanical insulator hosting zero-energy vibrational edge modes. We show that the linearized KL chain behaves as a thermal insulator at low temperature in both the topological phases with a finite band gap, and the heat current falls exponentially with the chain length. When the gap vanishes at the topological phase transition, the KL chain becomes a good thermal conductor and conducts heat ballistically. The chain of rotors for arbitrary angular displacements hosts nonlinear solitary waves and distinct topological mechanical phases. Our numerical analysis shows normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases of the nonlinear chain. Nevertheless, a finite thermal conductivity is achieved for different system sizes in different topological phases of this nonlinear chain.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling Driven Correlated and Charge-Ordered Electronic States in a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and Fermi-surface expansion induced by van Hove-driven ferromagnetic fluctuations: the D-TRILEX analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.</description>

      <title>Skeleton of isometric Tensor Network States for Abelian String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct parametrized isometric tensor network states -- referred to as skeletons -- that allow us to explore phases of abelian topological order and can be efficiently implemented on quantum processors. We obtain stable finite correlation length deformations of string-net fixed points, which are constructed both by conserving virtual symmetries of the tensor and by imposing local isometry constraints. They connect distinct topological phases via a shared critical point, thereby providing analytically tractable examples of phase transitions beyond anyon condensation. By mapping such classes of 2D tensor networks to 1D stochastic automata with local update rules, we show that expectation values of generalized Pauli strings of arbitrary weight can be efficiently computed using classical methods. Therefore these skeletons not only serve as an organizing principle for abelian topological order but also provide a non-trivial testbed for quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metamorphosis: Programmable Emergence and the Breakdown of Bulk-Edge Dichotomy in Multiscale Systems</title>

Abstract: Multiscale synergy -- the interplay of a system's distinct characteristic length, time, and energy scales -- is becoming a unifying thread across many contemporary branches of science. Ranging from moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $\alpha$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $\alpha$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Probing Local Topology in a Disordered Higher-Order Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topology is prized for its ability to realize lower-dimensional boundary states which are stable beyond fine-tuning. However, disorder presents a failure mechanism that can destroy topological in-gap states. Here, we investigate a disordered two-dimensional polariton lattice and employ the spectral localizer framework to define a real-space topological index rooted in crystalline spatial symmetries. This framework enables direct real-space mapping of topology beyond conventional momentum-space classifications, confirming the presence of corner and edge modes in this generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Furthermore, it can directly quantify topological protection of a state. We leverage the versatility of our platform to experimentally realize normally distributed, random disorder and find that the corner states persist until the spectral gap closes. Experimentally, this corresponds to a disorder strength of approximately one quarter of the spectral gap. The spectral localizer accurately identifies the disorder strength at which the bandgap closes, establishing the framework as a predictive tool for every finite size system. Our results broaden the design principles for higher-order topological insulators and open the way towards imple menting disorder-resilient devices for robust lasing, light-routing, and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest and next-to-nearest interactions on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transitions of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest $J_1$ and next-to-nearest $J_2$ interactions on the triangular lattice for $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0. The method of supervised neural networks (NN) is employed for the investigation. While supervised NN is used, no real spin configurations are needed for the training. In addition, two kinds of configurations having their spins be arranged in a staggered pattern are considered as the training set. Remarkably, with this unconventional training strategy, not only the critical temperatures of the studied $J_2/J_1$ are computed accurately by the resulting NN, but also the nature of the investigated phase transitions are determined correctly. Specifically, the phase transitions associated with $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0 are first order. These conclusions are consistent with the known results obtained by other methods. Since the training strategy is simple, the NN calculations is highly efficient. It remains to examine whether the unconventional training approach considered in this study can be used to investigate other models with untypical phase transitions or with nontrivial ground state configurations.</description>

      <title>From Random Determinants to the Ground State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ans\"atze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems. The compact explicit wavefunctions it produces further enable direct and rapid evaluation of observables.</description>

Abstract: In tensor-network analysis of quantum many-body systems, it is of crucial importance to employ a tensor network with a spatial structure suitable for representing the state of interest. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed a structural optimization algorithm for tree-tensor networks. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized transport and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

Abstract: Chiral phonons are desirable for applications in spintronics but their generation and control remains a challenge.Here we demonstrate the emergence of truly chiral phonons from selective magnon-phonon coupling in inversion-symmetric magnetic systems. Considering bcc Fe as example, we quantitatively calculate hybridized magnon-phonon quasiparticle states across the entire Brillouin zone utilizing first-principles calculations. Our findings challenge conventional magneto-elastic interpretations and reveal finite zero-point phonon angular momentum and strong anomalous thermal Hall responses linked to finite (spin) Berry curvatures. Our results further establish that the existence of chiral phonons, particularly along high-symmetry directions, is common in many magnetic materials, offering promising avenues for novel spintronic and phononic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized t-J model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom\'e bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom\'e bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom\'e as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unveil a unique critical phenomenon of topological edge modes in non-Hermitian systems, dubbed the critical non-Hermitian edge modes (CNHEM). Specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, the eigenvectors of edge modes jump discontinuously under infinitesimal on-site staggered perturbations. The CNHEM arises from the competition between the introduced on-site staggered potentials and size-dependent non-reciprocal coupling between edge modes, and are closely connected to the exceptional point (EP). As the system size increases, the coupling between edge modes decreases while the non-reciprocity is enhanced, causing the
  eigenvectors to gradually collapse toward the EP. However, when the on-site potentials dominate, this weakened coupling assists the eigenvectors to stay away from the EP. Such a critical phenomenon is absent in Hermitian systems, where the coupling between edge modes is reciprocal.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Fractional Chern Insulator Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of fractional Chern insulator stabilization against charge-ordered states. We argue that the phase competition is captured by an effective interaction range, which depends on both the bare interaction range and quantum geometric properties. We argue that short effective interaction ranges stabilize fractional states while longer-range interactions favor charge-ordered states. To confirm our hypothesis, we conduct a numerical study of the generalized Hofstadter model using the density matrix renormalization group. Our theory offers a new interpretation of the geometric stability hypothesis and generalizes it, providing a unifying framework for several approaches to fractional phase stabilization. Finally, we propose a route towards experimental verification of the theory and possible implications for fractional states in bands with higher Chern numbers.</description>

      <title>Probing ice-rule-breaking transition in $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film by proximitized transport and magnetic torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and $\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ (Yttria-stabilized Zirconia with 9.5 mol% $\rm{Y_2O_3}$) substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective nearest-neighbor interaction ($\rm{J_{eff}}=$ 1.054 K) and distorted Ising spin axes ($\rm{\epsilon}=+0.051)$ compared to the bulk crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetnetism in an altermagnet (MnF2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2 illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg spot with a change in handedness establishes a chiral signature for the fully compensated collinear antiferromagnet. The signature is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric quadrupole (E2) axial absorption events. Polar E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established MnF2 magnetic symmetry. It is compatible with atomic altermagnetism, and the corresponding order parameter contributes to E2-E2 and magnetic neutron Bragg diffraction patterns. Moreover, spin-flip patterns from polarized neutron diffraction depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests of the actual electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Pair-mixing induced Time-reversal-breaking superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.</description>

      <title>Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cage in Bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce field "hotspots" that can act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</description>

      <title>Anyons in the $\pi$-flux phase of fermionic matter coupled to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of weakly interacting spinful lattice fermions coupled to a dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Using reflection positivity, we prove that the ground state lies in the sector of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette and that the monopoles are massive. In the presence of a staggered mass for the fermions, this yields a fully gapped, four-dimensional ground state space on large tori. It is topologically ordered. By considering adiabatic $\pi$-flux insertion, we construct dressed monopole excitations, show that their self-braiding is proportional to the Hall conductance and hence vanishes, and prove that their braiding with the fermionic excitations is that of the toric code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.</description>
