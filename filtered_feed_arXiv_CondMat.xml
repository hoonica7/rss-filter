      <title>Anomalies on the Lattice, Homotopy of Quantum Cellular Automata, and a Spectrum of Invertible States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous topological theory of anomalies on the lattice, which are obstructions to gauging global symmetries and the existence of trivial symmetric states. We also construct $\Omega$-spectra of a class of invertible states and quantum cellular automata, which allows us to classify both anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases up to blend equivalence.</description>

      <title>$J_1-J_2$ Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field by combining large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with self-consistent spin-wave theory. The resulting field-coupling phase diagram reveals that quantum fluctuations stabilize coplanar order across the entire parameter range, giving rise to a characteristic sequence of magnetization plateaux. Near the quantum-spin-liquid window $0.06 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.14$, which extends to magnetic field $B \sim J_1$, we identify overlapping $m = 1/3$ and $m = 1/2$ plateaux - a distinctive hallmark of the system's proximity to the low-field spin-liquid regime. The excellent quantitative agreement between DMRG and self-consistent one-loop spin-wave calculations demonstrates that semiclassical approaches can reliably capture and parameterize the plateau phases of triangular quantum antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Accurate prediction of macroscopic transport from microscopic imaging via critical fractals at the Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) exhibits hysteresis in resistance while undergoing a thermally driven insulator-metal transition (IMT). Understanding the nonequilibrium effects in resistance is of great interest, as VO$_2$ is a strong candidate for brain-inspired computing, which is more energy efficient for AI tasks compared to traditional computing. Accurate models of the connection between microscopic and macroscopic transport properties and microscopic imaging of VO$_2$ will allow us to better utilize VO$_2$ in future applications. However, predictions of macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ that quantitatively match observations using spatially resolved data have not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the entire temperature range of interest, by developing a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, where the configuration of insulating and metallic domains within each pixel are drawn from the random field Ising model near criticality. This strongly indicates that the observed fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends down to much smaller length scales than the current record for experimental resolution of this system, and that the two-dimensional random field Ising model near criticality is a suitable model for describing the metal and insulator patches of VO$_2$ down to scales that approach the unit cell.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of carbon incorporation in sulfide thin films grown by hybrid pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vapor-pressure-mismatched materials, such as transition metal chalcogenides, have emerged as key electronic, photonic, and quantum materials. Hybrid pulsed laser deposition (hPLD) has become a preferred method for epitaxial or textured growth of these materials; however, unintentional carbon (C) incorporation remains a persistent concern, particularly when using organic chalcogen precursors as safer alternatives to toxic hydrides. The mechanisms governing C incorporation and its impact on film growth and properties in hPLD remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of C-containing side products generated from organosulfur precursor pyrolysis on ZnS, BaTiS$_3$, and TiS$_2$ thin films grown by hPLD using tert-butyl disulfide (TBDS). Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy, combined with secondary ion mass spectrometry, is used to systematically examine the effects of growth temperature and TBDS partial pressure on film morphology, crystallinity, and C incorporation. Optimal growth temperatures of 400{\deg}C, 500{\deg}C, and 700{\deg}C are identified for ZnS, TiS$_2$, and BaTiS$_3$, respectively. Growth above or below these temperatures leads to increased C incorporation at both the interface and within the film, correlating with degraded texture. In contrast, highly textured films exhibit minimal C content, comparable to films grown without TBDS. For TiS$_2$, C incorporation depends strongly on TBDS pressure, with 10$^{-1}$ Pa identified as the optimal pressure for minimizing contamination. At higher pressures, loss of preferential texture is observed, likely due to C graphitization poisoning the interface and bulk. These results provide new insight into process-induced C impurities in hPLD-grown chalcogenide thin films and have important implications for sulfide-based thin film technologies.</description>

      <title>Emergent Spin-Singlet Pairing in the Frustrated Kagome Metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metallic kagome compound Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ has attracted attention as a candidate platform where geometric frustration and itinerant electrons may cooperate to stabilize a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state. Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Perfect impedance matching unlocks sensitive radio-frequency reflectometry in 2D material quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive platforms for realizing high-performance quantum bits (qubits). However, radio-frequency (RF) charge detection, which is a key technique for qubits readout, remains challenging in such systems. We demonstrate RF reflectometry with impedance matching for high-resistance quantum dot devices based on bilayer graphene and molybdenum disulfide. By integrating a tunable strontium titanate (SrTiO3) varactor into a resonant circuit, we achieve nearly perfect impedance matching, enabling sensitive charge detection. The demodulated RF signal clearly shows Coulomb oscillations, and the SrTiO3 varactor exhibits robustness against both magnetic fields and voltage noise on the varactor. Our results establish SrTiO3 varactors as effective tunable matching components for RF reflectometry in high-resistance 2D material quantum devices, providing a foundation for high-speed qubits readout.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic interaction as random field for thermal transport in FPU-$\beta$ lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open quantum theory for the thermal transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-$\beta$(FPU-$\beta$) lattice. In the theory, local bosons(LBs) are introduced as carriers for the transport. The LBs are stimulated by individual atoms in the lattice, which are different from the phonons that are collective motions of the atoms. The LBs move in the FPU chain and are governed by a set of stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The anharmonic interaction between the atoms in the lattice is transformed to a random field by the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and has been implemented in the set of SDEs. By solving the set of SDEs at the steady state, we study the influence of the anharmonic interaction on the thermal transport. Results show that the anharmonic interaction decreases the thermal current by trapping the LBs on the lattice sites, as well as increase the thermal current by enhancing the amount of the LBs for the transport. The competition between these two mechanisms makes the thermal conductivity of the lattice dependent on the anharmonic interaction non-monotonically. The finite size effect of the thermal conductivity has also been captured by the theory.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity from crystal field fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel pairing mechanism for superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems, which often have both localised and itinerant charge carriers. An effective anisotropic interaction between the itinerant particles originates from the fluctuations in the crystal field associated with virtual hopping of the localised particles, a process that is also responsible for the Kondo exchange. Interestingly, this interaction is \emph{attractive} for charge transfer insulators such as cuprates. Considering a simple toy model for cuprates, without the antiferromagnetic exchange, this interaction leads to the correct d-wave superconducting gap, thus demonstrating its relevance.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Random Phase Approximation from Projective Truncation Approximation Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the self-consistent random phase approximations (sc-RPA) from the projective truncation approximation (PTA) for the equation of motion of two-time Green's function. The obtained sc-RPA applies to arbitrary temperature and recovers the Rowe's formalism at zero temperature. The PTA formalism not only rationalize Rowe's formula, but also provides a general framework to extend sc-RPA. We implement the sc-RPA calculation for the one-dimensional spinless fermion model in the parameter regime of disordered ground state, with the N-representability constraints enforced. The obtained ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree well with existing results. The features of the Luttinger liquid ground state and the continuum/bound state in the spectral function are well captured. We discuss several issues concerning the approximations made in RPAs, difficulties of RPA for symmetric state, and the static component problem of PTA.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coulomb drag signatures of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.</description>

      <title>Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by sequences of two unitaries: periodic, quasiperiodic and random protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of driving the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using two unitary operators $U_1$ and $U_2$ in different combinations; the unitaries differ in the values of the inter-cell hopping amplitudes. Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $\epsilon$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $\epsilon T$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $\epsilon^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $\epsilon$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results.</description>

      <title>Translational symmetry breaking in the electronic nematic phase of BaFe2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of the nematicity, namely, four-fold rotational symmetry breaking in iron-based superconductors has been controversial since its discovery. In particular, its relationship with the stripe-type spin-density-wave order and the orthorhombic lattice distortion in the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic (AFO) phase, which exists at temperatures below the electronic nematic phase, has been highly debated. Here, we report on the temperature evolution of angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the parent compound BaFe2As2, ranging from the AFO to nematic to paramagnetic phases. The Dirac cone feature, which is formed in the AFO phase, is found to persist in the nematic phase, suggesting that an antiferroic order of the same periodicity as the AFO phase persists in the nematic phase. Considering the relatively shallow d_xy orbital in BaFe2As2, we propose that an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy and other orbitals takes place in the nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady electron-excitonic complexes coupling in a two-dimensional semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons and their complexes govern optical-related behaviors in semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interac- tion mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two- dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of elec- tronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Emergent Chiral Spin Crystal Phase in (111) SrRuO3 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite ruthenates are fascinating playgrounds for exploring topological spin textures, but generally rely on extrinsic mechanisms to trigger the noncoplanar states. Here we report the discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase in (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a significant topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements with different propagation vectors along two orthogonal directions. Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films. These findings open a new pathway for creating and controlling the topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumps and universal geometry-induced drift velocity in multi-sliding quasi-periodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moir\'e-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.</description>

      <title>Tuning proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been observed in heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene (ML-G) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WSe$_{2}$. Successful tuning of SOC in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures by applying mechanical pressure and electric fields was also demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC. Here, we put these predictions to experimental test in ML-G/ML-WSe$_{2}$/hBN-heterostructures, where the twist angle is determined by aligning fractured edges, and by crystallographic etching of graphene. By performing weak anti-localization measurements, we determine the strength of the Rasbha-type SOC ($\lambda_\mathrm{R}$) and the valley-Zeeman-type SOC ($\lambda_\mathrm{VZ}$). Our experiments confirm a strong twist angle dependence of the proximity-induced SOC in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the tunability of the SOC strength via mechanical pressure, which is in agreement with earlier findings.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and Tunable Superconducting Diode Effect in Quantum Spin Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal dissipationless transport has long been sought for applications in superconducting technologies. Recently, it has been implemented by the so called superconducting diode effect. Such effect arises from an imbalance in critical supercurrents flowing in opposite directions. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how the superconducting diode effect emerges in the quantum spin Hall phase when brought into full proximity with a superconductor. We explore two regimes: large and narrow quantum wells. In the former geometry, we show that the superconducting diode effect can be externally controlled using both magnetic and electric fields, achieving unit efficiency. In the latter regime, where tunneling between opposite edges may occur, we propose a mechanism for an intrinsic superconducting diode effect driven by edge reconstruction, which does not require external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Precise Twist Angle Determination in twisted WSe2 via Optical Moir\'e Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) form moir\'e superlattices resulting in moir\'e minibands in momentum space and hosting localized excitons in real space. While moir\'e superlattices provide access to Mott-Hubbard physics, their energy potential landscape and electronic correlations are highly sensitive to fluctuations of the twist angle, disorder and lattice reconstructions. However, fast and non-invasive experimental access to local twist angle and its spatial variations is challenging. Here, we systematically correlate twist angle variations of twisted WSe2 bilayers across micrometer length scales using a combined lateral force microscopy (LFM) and a micro- Raman spectroscopy approach. These measurements uncover lateral variations in the twist angle by more than 1{\deg} across length scales relevant to optical and transport measurements. We demonstrate that twist angles in the range of 3{\deg} &lt; $\alpha$ &lt; 12{\deg} show distinct Raman response from scattering on optical moir\'e phonons allowing twist angle determination with high precision and sub-micrometer spatial resolution under ambient conditions. These modes are particularly sensitive in the low-angle twist regime, predicted to host emergent quantum phases. Our results establish micro-Raman spectroscopy of optical moir\'e phonons as a rapid, non-invasive probe to determine twist angle and to screen local twist angle variations with a precision better than $\pm$ 0.3{\deg} and a lateral resolution below one micrometer. This methodology is also applicable to fully hBN-encapsulated heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Kaganov-Lifshitz-Tanatarov theory for tilted Dirac-cone materials: anisotropic heating from uniform light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that in the tilted Dirac cone materials the non-equilibrium (hot) electron relaxation with phonons is anisotropic in the Brillouin zone. It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!</description>

      <title>Real-time imaging of slow noisy quasiparticle dynamics at a non-trivial metastable defect in an electronic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium self-assembly is the root of all emergent complexity, including life. In quantum materials emergent metastable states have become a very fashionable topic of research, but the study of resulting mesoscopic state dynamics is hindered by the absence of appropriate methods. Here we pioneer the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice created by a local electromagnetic perturbation. This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries. Two-level system telegraph noise maps at the junction show phase and amplitude that is correlated with the observed electron motion trajectories. Such observation of single-particle dynamics in real time fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements that make use of engineered topologically non-trivial defects.</description>

      <title>Emergent Quantum Valley Hall Insulator from Electron Interactions in Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide Heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of topological phases in moir\'{e} MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayer, highlighting the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions at two holes per moir\'e unit cell $v = 2$. Our analysis uncovers robust Quantum Valley Hall Insulating (QVHI) phase and reveals that long-range interactions alone can mediate the interlayer electron tunneling, generating topologically nontrivial bands even in the absence of the corresponding single-particle hopping. Additionally, we show that in the case of band mixing terms originating both from the interaction and single particle physics a competition between topological states realizing $s$-$wave$ and $p\pm ip$-$wave$ symmetries can appear. Moreover, within the considered theoretical framework, we present that by introducing a small Zeeman field, one can lift the band inversion in one of the valleys. This leads to a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) state with the topological gap opening in a single valley and the other being topologically trivial.</description>

      <title>Protein Diffusion and Stokes-Einstein Deviation in Supercooled Cryoprotectant Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vitrification during cryopreservation requires a detailed understanding of the dynamic behavior of biological solutions. We investigate ferritin diffusion in glycerol-water mixtures at supercooled temperatures using X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). Diffusion coefficients were measured from ambient conditions to $T = 210$ K and analyzed using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation, yielding an arrest temperature of $T_0 = 85 \pm 11$ K for ferritin ($R_{\rm h} = 7.3$ nm), markedly lower than $T_0 = 122 \pm 4$ K for larger nanoparticles ($R_{\rm h} = 50$ nm). Below $T \approx 230$ K, ferritin diffusion exceeds the Stokes-Einstein prediction by up to a factor of 2.7, revealing nanoscale deviations from bulk viscosity. A fluctuating-friction model quantitatively links this enhancement to local friction heterogeneity, with fluctuations increasing upon cooling and reaching $\sim 80\%$ of the mean friction at $T=210$ K. These results establish a molecular-scale connection between protein diffusion and solvent dynamical heterogeneity in cryoprotected solutions.</description>

      <title>Reaching Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev physics by shaking the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.</description>

      <title>X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy of hydrated lysozyme at elevated pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure provides a powerful parameter to control the protein conformation state, which at sufficiently high values can lead to unfolding. Here, we investigate the effects of increasing pressure up to $0.4$ GPa on hydrated lysozyme proteins, by measuring the nanoscale stress relaxation induced and probed by X-rays. Structural and dynamical information at elevated pressures was obtained using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) in combination with a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The dynamical analysis revealed a slowing down of the system up to $0.2$ GPa, followed by a re-acceleration at $0.4$ GPa. A similar non-monotonic behavior was observed both in the Porod and Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) exponents, consistently indicating a crossover between $0.2$ and $0.4$ GPa. These findings suggest the presence of pressure-induced structural changes that impact protein collective stress-relaxation as the system transitions from a jammed state to an elastically driven regime. These results may be relevant for a deeper understanding of protein stability under compression as well as for practical high-pressure technologies, including food processing and pharmaceutical applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Pseudospin Hall Effect and Multi-frequency Corner Modes in Kagome-based Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Second-Order Topological Superconductors with Tunable Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals, with their protected Dirac points, present an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal. In the normal state near half-filling, the Fermi surface consists of two distinct pockets, each enclosing a Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum ($\textbf{X}=(\pi,0)$ and $\textbf{Y}=(0,\pi)$). Considering an on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interaction, we use self-consistent mean-field theory to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry. We find that an even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is favored as it gives rise to a fully gapped superconducting state. Since the pairing amplitude has opposite signs on the two Dirac Fermi pockets, the superconducting state is identified as a second-order topological superconductor. The hallmark of this topological phase is the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries. Notably, the positions of these Majorana modes are highly controllable and can be manipulated simply by tailoring the boundary sublattice terminations. Our results highlight the promise of nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Realization of polytype heterostructures via delicate structural transitions from a doped-Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host multiple competing structural and electronic phases, making them an ideal platform for constructing polytype heterostructures with emergent quantum properties. However, controlling phase transitions to form diverse heterostructures inside a single crystal remains challenging. Here, we realize vertical/lateral polytype heterostructures in a hole-doped Mott insulator via thermal-annealing-induced structural transitions. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPM) confirm the coexistence of T-H polytype heterostructures. Atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements reveal the transparent effect in 1H/1T vertical heterostructures, where the charge density wave (CDW) of the underlying 1T-layer superposes on the top 1H-layer under positive bias. By systematically comparing 1T/1H and 1T/1T interfaces, we demonstrate that the metallic 1H-layer imposes a Coulomb screening effect on the 1T-layer, suppressing the formation of CDW domain walls and forming more ordered electronic states. These results clarify the interfacial coupling between distinct quantum many-body phases and establish a controllable pathway for constructing two-dimensional polytype heterostructures with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Positional memory of skyrmions in magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically and analytically study the transient dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets under a magnetic field gradient. We consider skyrmions in a bilayer with antiferromagnetic coupling between the layers. The skyrmions in the two layers move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and the motion is eventually halted with the two skyrmions at a distance from each other. We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approxi- mation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic Nature of Spinel Oxides: A Review of Their Electron Interactions and Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review discusses the multifaceted electronic properties of spinel oxides with a particular focus on Lithium Vanadate (LiV2O4), Lithium Titanate (LiTi2O4), and Magnesium Titanate (MgTi2O4). We selected LiTi2O4, LiV2O4, and MgTi2O4 because they serve as quintessential examples of spinel oxides' diverse and intriguing electronic phenomena. LiV2O4 heavy fermion behaviour challenges traditional theories in d-electron systems, LiTi2O4 being the first oxide superconductor provides critical insights into unconventional superconductivity driven by strong electron-phonon interactions, and MgTi2O4 pronounced orbital ordering and metalinsulator transition offers a clear model for exploring electron-lattice coupling. This shows how the inherent structural versatility of the spinel lattice, characterised by its cubic close-packed oxygen network and variable cation distributions, enables a rich interplay of electron-electron correlations, electron-lattice coupling, and orbital degrees of freedom. In LiV2O4, the combination of mixed-valence vanadium ions and a geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice gives rise to heavy fermion behaviour, whereas LiTi2O4 exhibits unconventional superconductivity driven by a high density of states at the Fermi level and strong electronphonon interactions. MgTi2O4 undergoes a pronounced metal-insulator transition, where orbital ordering triggers a Peierls-like distortion that stabilises a low-temperature insulating state through Ti-Ti dimerization. How the composition of these compounds affects their properties, based on both theoretical research and experimental findings, is illustrated by this review. It illustrates the promise of Spinels in practical technologies such as energy storage, electrocatalysis, and high-temperature lubrication.</description>

      <title>Tunable giant Purcell enhancement of quantum light emitters by means of acoustic graphene plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable ability of plasmons to boost radiative emission rates, we propose leveraging acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) to realize tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar quantum emitters. These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\% and 89\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $\lambda=1.55$ $\mu$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in Dirac electron tunneling transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction in the canonical ensemble. The free energy is obtained by mapping the model onto the spin-$1$ Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and solving it by using an Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation combined with the transfer matrix method. A complex structure with lines of first-order transitions, two triple points and a critical point appears at finite temperature. The phase diagram is two-dimensional, since there are two adjustable parameters, the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ and the temperature $T$. We show that the phase diagram does not present second-order phase transition lines, due to the fact that the order parameter is not a symmetry-breaking one. Quite remarkably, we are able to determine analytically one of the first-order phase-transition lines. We also prove that, when the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ is large and negative, the first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of $K$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field induced polarization enhancement in the photoluminescence of MBE-grown WSe$_2$ layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the magnetic-field dependence of the optically pumped valley polarization in an epitaxial tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer grown by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Circularly polarized photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that applying a weak out-of-plane magnetic field, on the order of 0.1 T, dramatically increases the effectiveness of the optical orientation of the emission associated with defect-bound localized excitons. We compare the obtained results with the earlier studies on the reference exfoliated monolayers, discussing both qualitative similarity as well as quantitative differences. Our observations are further supplemented by the results of time-resolved PL measurements, which confirm the pseudospin relaxation time of approximately 25 ps, a value significantly shorter than the $\approx$100 ps previously reported for mechanically exfoliated samples.</description>

      <title>Spinons and Spin-Charge Separation at the Deconfined Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo and numerical analytic continuation methods, we study the dynamic spin structure factor and the single-hole spectral function of a two-dimensional quantum magnet ($J$-$Q$ model) at its quantum phase transition separating N\'eel antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $\pi$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetoelectric Spin Field Effect Transistor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) are promising candidates for low-power spin-based electronics, yet existing realizations that rely on spin-orbit coupling are constrained by limited material choices and short spin-coherence lengths. Here we propose a different operating principle based on multiferroic altermagnets, in which spin splitting is tuned by an electric field through symmetry control rather than conventional spin-orbit physics. Using an effective model combined with quantum transport simulations, we show that the conductance is determined by the degree of matching between the electrically controlled spin texture of the channel and the fixed spin polarization of ferromagnetic contacts, enabling clear ON and OFF states. Remarkably, we also address a long-standing challenge in multiferroic device design: spintronic channels require metallic carriers, whereas ferroelectricity is usually suppressed in metals. We resolve this conflict by imprinting multiferroic altermagnetism into highly conductive materials via the proximity effect. First-principles calculations for graphene on multiferroic vanadium sulfide halides confirm that graphene acquires a ferroelectrically switchable spin splitting while retaining its metallic character. These results establish a practical route to SFET implementation and identify multiferroic altermagnets as a versatile platform for next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence of dominant excitonic instability in Ta2NiSe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator (EI) is a charge-neutral bosonic condensate of spontaneously formed electron-hole pairs. Exotic quantum phenomena such as dissipationless charge neutral transport and huge potential for optoelectronic applications have led to an extensive search for intrinsic bulk materials that are EIs at ambient pressure without sophisticated device fabrication. The narrow gap semimetal Ta2NiSe5 has been proposed as a rare example of an intrinsic EI, but its ground state has remained controversial since the EI phase transition is accompanied by a structural distortion. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to present microscopic evidence that supports an excitonic origin of the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5. First, we find that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent suggesting that the structural distortion is not the primary origin of insulating ground state. Second, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles which indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. Finally, the decay length of the in-gap states at the puddles shows similar value to the estimated size of the exciton wavefunction from previous photoemission studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and may be a versatile platform to study the physics of bosonic condensates in solid-state system at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological marker in three dimensions based on kernel polynomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic-scale influence of disorder on the topological order can be quantified by a universal topological marker, although the practical calculation of the marker becomes numerically very costly in higher dimensions. We propose that for any symmetry class in higher dimensions, the topological marker can be calculated in a very efficient way by adopting the kernel polynomial method. Using class AII in three dimensions as an example, which is relevant to realistic topological insulators like Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, this method reveals the criteria for the invariance of topological order in the presence of disorder, as well as the possibility of a smooth cross over between two topological phases caused by disorder. In addition, the significantly enlarged system size in the numerical calculation implies that this method is capable of capturing the quantum criticality much closer to topological phase transitions, as demonstrated by a nonlocal topological marker.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of the 2D Hubbard Model via Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate tensor network simulations of the two-dimensional Hubbard model by mapping the lattice onto a one-dimensional chain using space-filling curves. In particular, we focus on the Hilbert curve, whose locality-preserving structure minimizes the range of effective interactions in the mapped model. This enables a more compact matrix product state (MPS) representation compared to conventional snake mapping. Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost. These findings establish space-filling curve mappings, particularly the Hilbert curve, as a powerful tool for extending tensor-network studies of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems beyond the limits accessible with standard approaches.</description>

Abstract: We report numerical studies of the linear and nonlinear edge dynamics of a non-harmonically confined macroscopic fractional quantum Hall fluid. In the long-wavelength and weak excitation limit, observable consequences of the fractional transverse conductivity are recovered. The first non-universal corrections to the chiral Luttinger liquid theory are then characterized: for a weak excitation in the linear response regime, cubic corrections to the linear wave dispersion and a broadening of the dynamical structure factor of the edge excitations are identified; for stronger excitations, sizable nonlinear effects are found in the dynamics. The numerically observed features are quantitatively captured by a nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid quantum Hamiltonian that reduces to a driven Korteweg-de Vries equation in the semiclassical limit. Experimental observability of our predictions is finally discussed.</description>

Abstract: Making use of refermionization techniques, we map the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid model of the edge modes of a spatially confined fractional quantum Hall cloud developed in our recent work [Phys. Rev. A 107, 033320 (2023)] onto a one-dimensional system of massive and interacting chiral fermions, whose mass and interactions are set by the filling factor of the quantum Hall fluid and the shape of the external confining potential at the position of the edge. As an example of the predictive power of the refermionized theory, we report a detailed study of the dynamic structure factor and of the spectral function of a fractional quantum Hall cloud. Among other features, our refermionized theory provides a physical understanding of the effective decay of the edge excitations and of the universal power-law exponents at the thresholds of the dynamic structure factor. The quantitative accuracy of the refermionized theory is validated against a full two-dimensional calculation based on a combination of exact diagonalization and Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and hidden quantum geometry in charge neutral twisted trilayer graphene</title>

Abstract: Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moir\'e Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bifurcation and Anomalous Supercurrent in Dissipative Topological Insulator-based Josephson Junctions</title>

Abstract: The interplay between topological protection and dissipation constitutes a critical frontier in the realization of hybrid quantum devices. Here, we investigate the transport signatures in a dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junction, a platform that directly probes the competition between quantum coherence and loss. We model dissipation by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead to the junction, described effectively by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived using the Lindblad formalism. We observe that the junction exhibits an asymmetric complex Andreev spectrum, where the imaginary energy component imposes a finite lifetime on the quasi-bound states. Furthermore, beyond specific phase intervals, the real component of the spectrum bifurcates: one branch merges with the continuum, while the other penetrates just below the superconducting gap. Crucially, the characteristic zero-energy crossing shifts away from $\phi=\pi$ and acquires a non-zero imaginary component; consequently, the associated Majorana bound states acquire a finite lifetime, signaling a loss of robustness against dissipation. Finally, this spectral asymmetry drives an anomalous supercurrent, manifested as a non-vanishing current at zero phase difference. Our results reveal how dissipation fundamentally reshapes superconducting transport in topological junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Current-Induced Zero-Resistance State in Valley-Polarized Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed nonreciprocal current-induced zero-resistance state (CIZRS) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure has posed a significant theoretical challenge. In the experiment, the system shows a zero-resistance state only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular direction, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small resistance when the current is small or flows in the opposite direction. In this Letter, we provide a theory of CIZRS. We show that the threefold degenerate Fulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized by the valley polarization and trigonal warping effects of twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Moreover, a current flowing in a particular direction breaks the threefold degeneracy and favors a particular FF pairing domain. We therefore propose that the incipient superconducting state is naturally understood as a multidomain state where the interdomain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson coupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta between different FF domains. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a certain FF state and create monodomain pathways with zero resistance. Crucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in the opposite direction can fail to generate the zero-resistance pathways, thus giving rise to the observed nonreciprocity. Finally, we suggest that the long-sought-after triangular finite-momentum state can also be realized in valley-polarized superconductors.</description>

      <title>Light-Driven Bound State of Interacting Impurities in a Dirac-Like Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum impurities under periodic driving can exhibit emergent non-Hermitian phenomena, yet a microscopic understanding has been lacking. We introduce an auxiliary-fermion framework that captures the bath's spin-orbit and angular-momentum structure and generates an effective low-energy theory with symmetry-protected spin-selective gain-loss channels. Exceptional points (EPs) arise dynamically from hybridization, without inserting non-Hermitian terms by hand, while causality is preserved via sign-reversing contributions. Near EPs, eigenvector non-orthogonality strongly enhances the impurity density of states, boosting the Kondo scale according to the condition number of the effective Hamiltonian. This DOS enhancement provides a directly measurable signature of EPs in impurity systems when spin-flip processes are induced experimentally. The pseudo-Hermitian structure further enables a biorthogonal thermodynamic Bethe ansatz treatment of interactions. Our results establish a unified route by which driven environments can engineer correlated, emergent non-Hermitian impurity states, opening a new avenue to control quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description>

      <title>Approximate half-integer quantization in anomalous planar transport in $d$-wave altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous planar transport phenomena in a recently identified class of collinear magnetic materials known as $d$-wave altermagnets. The anomalous planar effects manifest in a configuration when the applied electric field/temperature gradient, magnetic field, and the measured Hall voltage are all co-planar, but the planar magnetic field is instrumental in breaking $\hat{C}_{4z}\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ symmetry of the $d$-wave altermagnet, where $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is the time reversal operator, resulting in a Zeeman gap at a shifted Dirac node and a nonzero Berry curvature monopole. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit nearly half-quantized anomalous planar Hall and planar thermal Hall effects at low temperatures that persist over a range of magnetic fields. The angular dependence of the planar transport reveals a $\cos2\phi$ dependence on the magnetic field direction, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle made by the magnetic field. We also discuss the anomalous planar Nernst effect, or transverse thermopower, and demonstrate that the Nernst conductivity peaks when the chemical potential lies just outside the induced Zeeman gap and vanishes within the gap. We further explore the dependence of all three coefficients on the polar and the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field when it is rotated in the full $3D$ space. Our results reveal the presence of approximately half-quantized anomalous planar thermal Hall plateau for a range of in-plane magnetic fields without requiring topological superconductivity and conducting Majorana modes, and can be probed in experiments in $d$-wave altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: In the research of the topological band phases, the conventional wisdom is to start from the crystalline translational symmetry systems. Nevertheless, the translational symmetry is not always a necessary condition for the energy bands. Here we propose a systematic method of constructing the topological band insulators without translational symmetry in the amorphous systems. By way of the isospectral reduction approach from spectral graph theory, we reduce the structural-disordered systems formed by different multi-atomic cells into the isospectral effective periodic systems with the energy-dependent hoppings and potentials. We identify the topological band insulating phases with extended bulk states and topological in-gap edge states by the topological invariants of the reduced systems, density of states, and the commutation of the transfer matrix. In addition, when the building blocks of the two multi-atomic cells have different number of the lattice sites, our numerical calculations demonstrate that the existences of the flat band and the macroscopic bound states in the continuum in the amorphous systems. Our findings uncover an arena for the exploration of the topological band states beyond translational symmetry systems paradigm.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity longitudinal magnetoconductivity in time-reversal symmetry broken materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity} (OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture. Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ordering in Moir\'e Graphene Multilayers from a Continuum Hartree+U Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, symmetry-broken ground states, such as correlated insulating states, magnetic order and superconductivity, have been discovered in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) near the so-called magic-angle. Understanding the magnetic order in these systems is challenging, however, as atomistic methods become extremely expensive near the magic angle and continuum approaches fail to capture important atomistic details. In this work, we develop an approach to incorporate short-ranged Hubbard interactions self-consistently in a continuum model. In addition, we include long-ranged Coulomb interactions, which are known to be important when doping the flat bands of tBLG and tTLG. Therefore, for the first time, magnetic order in moir\'e graphene multilayers is self-consistently explored in a continuum model with atomistic detail. With this approach, we perform a systematic analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of tBLG as a function of doping level and twist angle, near the magic angle. Our results are consistent with previous perturbative atomistic Hartree+U calculations. Furthermore, we investigated magnetic order of tTLG, which were found to be similar to those in tBLG. In the future, the developed continuum model can be utilized to investigate magnetic ordering tendencies from short-range exchange interactions in other moir\'e graphene multilayers as a function of doping, twist angle, screening environment, among other variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the emergence of non-Abelian zero modes from twist defects in Abelian topological phases. We consider a setup built from a fractional quantum Hall (or a fractional Chern insulator)-superconductor heterostructure, which effectively induces a phase transition, leading to a topological phase endowed with new anyonic symmetries, and accordingly supporting distinct types of zero modes at fixed filling. These defects are modeled at the interface between two copies of the same heterostructure arranged side by side, which produces counterpropagating modes that can be gapped by interactions that realize the anyonic symmetries. We characterize the parafermions associated with each anyonic symmetry and discuss how their presence affect the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.</description>

Abstract: Topology, as a mathematical concept, has been introduced into condensed matter physics since the discovery of quantum Hall effect, which characterizes new physical scenario beyond the Landau theory. The topologically protected physical quantities, such as the dissipationless quantum transport of edge/surface states as well as magnetic/dipole quasi-particles like skyrmions/bimerons, have attracted great research enthusiasms in the past decades. In recent years, another kind of topology in condensed matter was revealed in the magnetoelectric parameter space of multiferroics, which deepens our understanding of magnetoelectric physics. This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft. These exotic topological magnetoelectric behaviors may be helpful to pursuit energy-efficient and precise-control devices for spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Probing confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics and play an important role in condensed matter physics. The constituents of gauge theories, for example charged matter and electric gauge field, are governed by local gauge constraints, which lead to key phenomena such as confinement of particles that are not fully understood. In this context, quantum simulators may address questions that are challenging for classical methods. While engineering gauge constraints is highly demanding, recent advances in quantum computing are beginning to enable digital quantum simulations of gauge theories. Here, we simulate confinement dynamics in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on a superconducting quantum processor. Tuning a term that couples only to the electric field produces confinement of charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we show how a modification of the gauge constraint from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ towards $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work illustrates the restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory, it showcases how gauge constraints can be modified and protected, and it promotes the study of other models governed by multi-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Second-Harmonic Magnetoacoustic Ultrasound from Magnetic Nanoparticles under Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields</title>

Abstract: We report experimental evidence of mechanical wave generation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs, 65mT, 800 kHz, at 100ms bursts) in the ultrasonic (US) frequency range. We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>
