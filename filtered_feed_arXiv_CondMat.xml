      <title>Parametric Instabilities of Correlated Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum materials exhibit a rich landscape of ordered phases with highly tunable properties, making them an intriguing platform for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Zone Boundary Magnon Propagation in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering in the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ reveals strong non-reciprocal effects on magnon propagation at the boundary of the nuclear Brillouin zone. The non-reciprocal response is strongest at a central position between the zone corner and edge mid-point. We explain these results using an effective linear spin-wave model. While directional effects in chiral magnets have so far only been known to exist at low momenta close to the center of the Brillouin zone, the present study shows that non-reciprocity persists at the highest possible reduced momenta. The observed magnons show very little damping within the limits of our experimental resolution, making them of great interest for the fundamental research on compact, high-frequency magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model revealed by neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the ground state of the square lattice Hubbard model exhibits superconductivity re- mains a major open question, central to understanding high temperature cuprate superconductors and ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices. Numerical studies have found evidence for stripe-ordered states and superconductivity at strong coupling but the phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we show that one can resolve the subtle energetics of metallic, superconducting, and stripe phases using a new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions that extend hidden fermion de- terminant states to Pfaffians. We simulate several hundred electrons using fast Pfaffian algorithms allowing us to measure off-diagonal long range order. At strong coupling and low hole-doping, we find that a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails, while superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime, with |t-prime| &gt; 0.1. At larger doping levels, we introduce momentum-space correlation functions to mitigate finite size effects that arise from weakly-bound pairs. These provide evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity at U = 4, even when t-prime = 0. Our results highlight the potential of NQS approaches, and provide a fresh perspective on superconductivity in the square lattice Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure evolution and magnetoelastic coupling across the spin reorientation transition in TmCrO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetic structure evolution across the spin reorientation transition in orthorhombic (Pnma) TmCrO3. Magnetic susceptibility reveals canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ordering at T_N = 125 K, two compensation points (T_comp1 and T_comp2), followed by magnetization reversal with a magnetic susceptibility minimum between T_comp1 and T_comp2. Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'. Furthermore, the ordered moments of Cr and Tm in TmCrO3 exhibit a complex, non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the Tm sublattice driving the spin-reorientation transition near the compensation point. Anomalies in the lattice parameters reveal strong magnetoelastic coupling, linking structural distortions to the SRO.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetry-breaking in a kagome Ising ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals can host unconventional electronic phenomena that emerge from their frustrated lattice geometry and associated band topology. Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism.</description>

      <title>Topological Metal-Insulator Transition within the Ferromagnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in condensed matter physics is integrating topological phenomena with correlated electron physics to leverage both types of states for next-generation quantum devices. Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) are central to bridging these two domains while simultaneously serving as 'on-off' switches for electronic states. Here, we demonstrate how the prototypical material of K2Cr8O16 undergoes a ferromagnetic MIT accompanied by a change in band topology. Through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that this transition is not driven by a Peierls mechanism, given the lack of phonon softening. Instead, we establish the transition as a topological MIT within the ferromagnetic phase (topological-FM-MIT) with potential axionic properties, where electron correlations play a key role in stabilizing the insulating state. This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and represents a fundamentally new class of topological phase transitions, revealing a unique pathway through which magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations interact.</description>

      <title>The pseudogap and strange metal states in the square-lattice Hubbard model: a comprehensive study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To clarify the origin of the pseudogap and strange metal states as well as their mutual relationship in cuprate superconductors, a comprehensive study on the spectral function, Fermi surface, resistivity and dynamical spin susceptivity of the Hubbard model on the square lattice has been conducted by means of the ladder dual-fermion approximation with an electron self-energy correction. It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $\omega/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous dynamic state in the double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KBaFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional (3D) magnet KBaFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ hosts a double-trillium lattice of Fe$^{3+}$ (spin, $S=5/2$) ions offering a prototypical platform to study the frustration induced effects in 3D. Through magnetization, specific heat, $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) experiments, supported by first principles calculations, we uncover an unconventional ground state. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions with a large Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{\rm CW} = -70(2)$ K, no magnetic long-range order is observed down to 30 mK. Below $T^{\ast}\simeq 3.5$ K, the NMR linewidth becomes nearly field-independent and the spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ saturates, accompanied by an inhomogeneous distribution of transverse nuclear magnetization $M_{xy}$. The latter indicates the emergence of short-range dynamical correlations, which was further corroborated by a robust and field-insensitive broad maximum in specific heat. In $\mu$SR, we detect neither a static internal field nor spin freezing; instead the relaxation remains dynamic and is best described by two coexisting dynamic relaxation channels: a dominant fast (sporadic) channel and a slower Markovian component. Their differing weights and fluctuation rates suggest microscopic inhomogeneity in spin dynamics. Altogether, KBaFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ exemplifies a rare high-spin stochiometric 3D antiferromagnet that evades ordering and instead fosters a mosaic of spin dynamics driven by strong geometric frustration intrinsic to the trillium lattice.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow and Bogomolny bounds for quantum metric actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate gradient flow dynamics generated by two natural actions of the quantum metric for an isolated set of Bloch bands. Specializing to two spatial dimensions, we derive Bogomolny-type lower bounds that relate these actions to the Chern number and show that the bounds are saturated by (anti-)holomorphic projector configurations. Along the flows, the actions decrease monotonically while the Chern number is conserved, giving a constructive route to simplify models within a fixed topological phase toward canonical, low-complexity representatives.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Correlations in Aqueous Alkylamine Mixtures Between Molecular and Micro Emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how molecular correlations give rise to mesoscale organization is central to the physics of complex fluids such as hydrogen-bonded mixtures. In this work, we develop a mesoscale bridge formalism that connects the site-site Ornstein-Zernike (SSOZ) framework to the field theoretical Teubner-Strey (TS) approach. This bridge highlights how local orientational correlations, typically lost in the SSOZ closure, reemerge as effective long-range components at the mesoscale. The resulting theory provides a unified description of density fluctuations spanning molecular to mesoscopic length scales. The approach is illustrated using X-ray scattering spectra from simulated and experimental hydrogen-bonded fluids, showing that the TS representation captures the essential features of the mesoscale structure. Beyond this specific application, the proposed formalism offers a general route to interpret the structural crossover between microscopic interactions and collective mesoscale organization in complex fluids, including aqueous and amphiphilic systems.</description>

      <title>High and Magnetic-field-dependent Surface Carriers Mobility in 3D Topological Insulators without Bulk States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying the conventional two-liquid model to the magnetoresistivity tensor, we reveal a record-high carrier mobility for surface states in tetradymite topological insulators ($\sim$ 20000 cm$^2$/Vs) in both bulk crystals and thin flakes of Sn-Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S. Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($&gt;1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Implementation and application of a DFT$+U$$+V$ approach within the all-electron FLAPW method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of the density-functional theory DFT$+U$$+V$ formalism within the all-electron full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method as implemented in the FLEUR code. The DFT$+U$$+V$ formalism extends DFT, supplemented by the onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, to address local correlation effects in localized states by incorporating intersite Coulomb interaction terms $V$. It holds promise for improving charge and bond disproportionation, charge and orbital ordering, charge density wave formation, charge transfer, and the intersite correlation resulting from hybridization between states of neighboring sites in a solid. $U$ and $V$ parameters are obtained from first principles using the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) employing two different atom basis representations to project the screened Coulomb interaction: the Wannier and the muffin-tin basis functions. We investigate in detail the impact of the $V$ term for typical covalently bonded materials like graphene, for bulk semiconductors such as silicon and germanium, and for charge-transfer insulators like NiO. Our results demonstrate an improvement in accuracy of specific properties across these systems, providing a framework for describing materials with different interaction regimes. We compare our DFT$+U$$+V$ results using our cRPA parameter sets with (i) previous DFT$+U$$+V$ calculation employing pseudopotential approximations, (ii) with experimental results and (iii) with our $GW$ results.</description>

      <title>Localization transitions in an open quasiperiodic ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate localization transition in an open quasiperiodic ladder where the quasiperiodicity is described by the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model. While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order.</description>

Abstract: Friction accounts for up to 30% of global energy consumption, underscoring the urgent need for superlubricity in advanced materials. Two-dimensional (2D) electrides are layered materials with cationic layers separated by 2D confined electrons that act as anions. This study reveals the unique frictional properties of these compounds and the underlying mechanisms. We establish that interlayer friction correlates with the cationic charges and sliding-induced charge redistribution. Remarkably, the 2D electride Ba2N stands out for its lower interlayer friction than graphene, despite its stronger interlayer adhesion, defying conventional tribological understanding. This anomalous behavior arises from electron redistribution as the dominant energy dissipation pathway. Combining ab initio calculations and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, we show that incommensurate twisted interfaces (2{\deg} &lt; {\theta} &lt; 58{\deg}) in Ba2N achieve structural superlubricity by suppressing out-of-plane buckling and energy corrugation. Notably, a critical normal load of 2.3 GPa enables barrier-free sliding in commensurate Ba2N ({\theta} = 0{\deg}), with an ultralow shear-to-load ratio of 0.001, suggesting the potential for superlubricity. Moreover, electron doping effectively reduces interlayer friction by controllably modulating stacking energies in 2D electrides. These findings establish 2D electrides as a transformative platform for energy-efficient tribology, enabling scalable superlubricity through twist engineering, load adaptation, or electrostatic gating. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of electron-mediated friction, with Ba2N serving a model system for cost-effective, high-performance material design.</description>

      <title>Suppression of magnetism in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ under external pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control the magnetic state provides a powerful means to tune the underlying band topology, enabling transitions between distinct electronic phases and the emergence of novel quantum phenomena. In this work, we address the evolution of ferromagnetic state upon applying external pressures up to 10.8~GPa using a combined experimental and theoretical study. The standard \emph{ab initio} Density Functional Theory computation including ionic relaxations grossly overestimates the unit cell magnetization as a function of pressure. In our theoretical analysis we identify two possible mechanisms to remedy this shortcoming. Matching the experimental observations is achieved by a symmetry-preserving adjustment of the sulfur atoms position within the unit cell. Alternatively, we explore various combinations of the exchange and correlation parts of the effective potential which reproduce the experimental magnetization, the structural parameters and the measured optical conductivity spectra. Thus, the pressure-dependent behavior of magnetization demands a careful theoretical treatment and analysis of theoretical and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Carrier-envelope phase control of ultrafast photocurrents in layered MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate carrier-envelope-phase (CEP)-controlled photocurrents in mono-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS$_2$ driven by few-cycle laser pulses. The photocurrent in the two-terminal devices scales quadratically with the field amplitude, indicating perturbative carrier dynamics in the weak-field regime distinct from strong-field tunnelling. Our results extend light-field-sensitive current control from bulk dielectrics, semiconductors, and graphene to two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting their potential for electric-field sensitive optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>High-Winding-Number Zero-Energy Edge States in Rhombohedral-Stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of rhombohedral-stacked N-layer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger networks with interlayer coupling. We find that these systems exhibit $2N$-fold degenerate zero-energy edge states with winding number $W=N$, providing a direct route to high-winding-number topological phases where $W$ equals the layer number. Using effective Hamiltonian theory and Zak phase calculations, we demonstrate that the winding number scales linearly with $N$ through a layer-by-layer topological amplification mechanism. We introduce the Wigner entropy as a novel detection method for these edge states, showing that topological boundary states exhibit significantly enhanced Wigner entropy compared to bulk states. Our results establish rhombohedral stacking as a systematic approach for engineering high-winding-number topological insulators with potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Growth-Controlled Twinning and Magnetic Anisotropy in CeSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerium diantimonide (CeSb$_2$) is a layered heavy-fermion Kondo lattice material that hosts complex magnetism and pressure-induced superconductivity. The interpretation of its in-plane anisotropy has remained unsettled due to structural twinning, which superimposes orthogonal magnetic responses. Here we combine controlled crystal growth with magnetization and rotational magnetometry to disentangle the effects of twinning. Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\text{easy}}(4~\text{T}) \approx 1.8~\mu_{\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response. These results resolve long-standing discrepancies in reported magnetic measurements, in which in-plane metamagnetic transition fields and saturation magnetization varied significantly across previous studies. Growth experiments demonstrate that avoiding the proposed $\alpha$-$\beta$ structural transition $-$ through Sb-rich flux and slower cooling $-$ systematically reduces twinning. However, powder X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis measurements show no clear evidence of a distinct $\beta$ phase. Our results establish a consistent magnetic phase diagram and provide essential constraints for crystal-electric field models, enabling a clearer understanding of the interplay between anisotropic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in CeSb$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the manipulation of complex oxide layers, particularly the fabrication of atomically thin cuprate superconducting films via molecular beam epitaxy, have revealed new ways in which nanoscale engineering can govern superconductivity and its interwoven electronic orders. In parallel, the creation of twisted cuprate heterostructures through cryogenic stacking techniques marks a pivotal step forward, exploiting cuprate superconductors to deepen our understanding of exotic quantum states and propel next-generation quantum technologies. This review explores over three decades of research in the emerging field of cuprate twistronics, examining both experimental breakthroughs and theoretical progress. It also highlights the methodologies poised to surmount the outstanding challenges in leveraging these complex quantum materials, underscoring their potential to expand the frontiers of quantum science and technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically a process of cooling electrons using a superconducting tunnel junction with a $\pi$ phase difference and a usual insulator or a ferroelectric in-between, and an array of such junctions with ferroelectric layers in-between. These setups have a complex structure of entropy due to nodal lines, where the density of states can be divergent or larger than for a free electron gas at a chemical potential level. We consider a small current running from the bath of electrons through the setup, where electrons have to have higher entropy, and thus remove heat from the bath.</description>

      <title>D-Wave Phonon Angular Momentum Texture in Altermagnets by Magnon-Phonon-Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In altermagnets, the magnon bands are anisotropically spin-split in reciprocal space without relativistic or dipolar spin-spin interactions. In this work, we theoretically study magnons and phonons coupled by spin-lattice interaction in a two-dimensional square-lattice $d$-wave altermagnet. We show that phonon-chirality-selective magnon-phonon hybridization can be caused by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to the emergence of hybrid quasiparticles that possess finite phonon angular momentum. These hybrid quasiparticles are called magnon polarons and consist of spin-polarized magnons and chiral phonons. Their phonon angular momentum texture follows the $d$-wave character of the magnon spin texture opening up the possibility of phononic counterparts to the electronic response effects in altermagnets, such as a \emph{phonon angular momentum splitter effect}, i.e., the generation of a transverse phonon angular momentum current induced by a temperature gradient -- the bosonic analogue of the spin-splitter effect.</description>

      <title>Porous-B$_{18}$: An Ideal Topological Semimetal with Symmetry-Enforced Orthogonal Nodal-Line and Nodal-Surface States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals (TSMs) featuring symmetry-protected band degeneracies have attracted considerable attention due to their exotic quantum properties and potential applications. While nodal line (NL) and nodal surface (NS) semimetals have been extensively studied, the realization of a material where both NL and NS coexist and are intertwined, particularly with an ideal electronic band structure, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predict via first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis a metastable boron allotrope, Porous-B$_{18}$ (space group $P6_3/m$, No.~176), as a pristine TSM hosting a NS and two straight NLs near the Fermi level. The structure, a honeycomb-like porous 3D framework, exhibits excellent dynamical, thermal (stable up to 1000~K), and mechanical stability. Its electronic band structure is remarkably clean: only the highest valence band (HVB) and the lowest conduction band (LCB) cross linearly within a large energy window of 1.84~eV, free from trivial-band interference. The nodal surface lies on the $k_z = \pm \pi$ planes, protected by combined time-reversal symmetry ($T$) and twofold screw-rotational symmetry ($S_{2z}$), yielding a full-plane Kramers-like degeneracy. The two nodal lines along $K$--$H$ and $K'$--$H'$ are protected by inversion and time-reversal symmetries, carry a quantized Berry phase of $\pm \pi$, and connect orthogonally to the nodal surface, forming an intertwined nodal network. Drumhead surface states on the $(1\bar{1}0)$ surface further confirm the nontrivial topology. Porous-B$_{18}$ thus provides an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between nodal-line and nodal-surface fermions and exploring novel quantum transport phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in performing muon experiments is knowing which temperatures and applied fields to measure at, and how many muon decays should be measured at each temperature/field combination to get the most useful dataset. We have developed a technique using Fisher information which, for a given muon asymmetry function, can analytically calculate the number of muon decays required to obtain a given error on the parameters of the asymmetry model. Here, we report on the results of our project, in particular applying our methodology to the problem of knowing the best choice of applied longitudinal fields for ionic diffusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Second-Harmonic Magnetoacoustic Ultrasound from Magnetic Nanoparticles under Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of mechanical wave generation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs, 65mT, 800 kHz, at 100ms bursts) in the ultrasonic (US) frequency range. We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic.</description>

      <title>Remanent crustal strain on Mars in non-poikilitic olivine of NWA 7721</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the non-poikilitic lithology of the poikilitic shergottite NWA 7721, using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and context in situ 2D micro-XRD. A single olivine crystal contains two distinct subgrain populations. Type 1 subgrains are fine (1-5 micrometers), randomly oriented, and nearly strain-free, whereas Type 2 subgrains are coarse (greater than 30 micrometers), aligned, and strongly strained. Layered DFXM data reveal slip-band features in Type 2 that are absent in Type 1. We interpret Type 1 as products of shock-induced recrystallization, whereas Type 2 preserves remnants of a highly deformed parent grain. This bimodal microstructure, not observed in other Martian meteorites including the paired NWA 1950 and ALH A77005, points to a heterogeneous response to impact influenced by pre-existing strain in the olivine grain. We propose that NWA 7721 olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before impact. The subsequent shock wave imposed a rapid load-release cycle that mobilized dislocations and produced low-angle boundaries in Type 2, while driving recrystallization of Type 1. Grain-growth constraints limit the post-shock heating duration to approximately 2.3 s, consistent with rapid quenching. These results provide the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars in the Late Amazonian.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing for lattice models with competing long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.</description>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials that exhibit a diverse range of electronic structures, including charge density waves (CDWs) that can lead to insulating, semiconducting, metallic, and even superconducting phases. While the formation of CDWs in these systems has been recognized in early research [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 156401 (2022); Nat. Phys. 11, 328 (2015)], the underlying mechanisms driving the commensurate CDW (CCDW) phase remain largely unexplored. CCDWs typically originate from factors such as perfect Fermi surface nesting and/or electron-phonon coupling, causing the divergence of the chiral electronic structure. However, in the case of layered 2D TMD materials with CCDW phases, the significance of reconstructed electronic structures resulting from periodic lattice distortions (PLD) and photoemission matrix element effects in the CCDW instability needs to be visualized. This study focuses on computationally accessible CCDW phases in 1T-Ta$S_2$, a prototypical TMD with a rich CDW phase diagram, aiming to understand the origins of CCDW phases. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to advance the application of 2D materials in next-generation electronics, quantum sensing and information science.</description>

Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

      <title>Nature of quantum criticality in the Ising ferromagnet TbV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a topological metal where ferromagnetic Tb ions with strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy interact with V kagome layers. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements show that the Tb ions adopt an Ising doublet ground state. Here, we consider whether a transverse magnetic field can drive TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ toward a quantum critical point, providing a rare example of transverse-field Ising criticality in a metallic compound. High-field magnetization measurements reveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T. Our INS-based magnetic model finds that this is caused by an avoided crossing of an excited-state singlet with the ground-state doublet. Surprisingly, our model predicts that quantum critical and tricritical points are accessible within the range of experimentally determined model parameters and may be reached by varying the direction of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological information of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom setup comparable to commercial printers. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. We complement the experiments with computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow inside the printing nozzle, incorporating filament melting through an enthalpy-porosity formulation and treating the air-polymer melt interface using a two-phase approach. The simulated velocity profiles agree closely with the XPTV measurements across the investigated operating conditions, supporting the experimental interpretation. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this is the first application of XPTV to polymer melt rheology. It enables measurements that are inaccessible to conventional optical methods.</description>

Abstract: High-quality two-dimensional (2D) dielectrics are crucial for fabricating 2D/3D hybrid vertical electronic devices such as metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) based Schottky diodes and hot electron transistors, the production of which is constrained by the scarcity of bulk layered wide bandgap semiconductors. In this research, we present the synthesis of a new 2D dielectric, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form, over a large area (&gt;300 um2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, we tune the thickness of InO2 where predominantly (~85%) monolayer InO2 is formed. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the band gap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1 eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7 eV). Furthermore, MOS-based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n-SiC demonstrate that the EG/n-SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87 eV and a rectification ratio of ~10^5. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D dielectric family, showing significant potential for monolayer InO2 to be used as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum phenomena arising from the interplay between electron correlations and nontrivial topology. However, the microscopic mechanism governing the emergence of both the integer and fractional Chern insulator states in this system remains an open question. In this work, we systematically investigate the electrical transport properties of RMG/hBN moir\'e devices with controlled alignment orientations and twist angles. We demonstrate that alignment orientation strongly modulates correlated phenomena in the moir\'e-proximal regime, while having negligible influence on the formation of integer and fractional Chern insulators in the moir\'e-distant regime. Instead, the moir\'e periodicity, tuned by the twist angle, serves as the key parameter controlling the stability of these correlated topological states in the moir\'e-distant regime. Furthermore, in the moir\'e-proximal regime of one specific alignment, we observe anomalous Hall effect and a variety of competing phases near {\nu} = 1, including integer Chern insulator states, extended Chern insulator states, and trivial insulators, whose stability is highly sensitive to both the applied displacement electric field and magnetic field. Our results underscore the critical role of stacking-alignment and twist-angle engineering in exploring novel quantum states based on rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded $\pi$-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials that are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) is synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, the quantum transport properties of hNPGs are studied. It is found that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). A simple model is proposed to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, it is found that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

      <title>A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three- dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional spinless Euler insulators with rotational symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry. Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between gapped phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between a gapped phase in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and a phase where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We characterize the possible patterns of symmetry fractionalization in these phases and provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits the transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</description>

Abstract: We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.</description>

      <title>On the criticality of the configuration-space statistical geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2\beta/\nu}$, provided that the system possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4\beta/\nu &lt; d$. We validate this scaling with stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the transverse-field Ising model(TFIM). Furthermore, we propose configuration-space diagnostics that go beyond local real-space observables. First, the distribution probability $P(r_H)$ parameterized by the transverse field $h$ forms a one-dimensional manifold. Information-geometric analyses, particularly the Fisher information defined on this manifold, successfully pinpoint the TFIM phase transition, regardless of the measurement basis. Second, for the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Heisenberg model, a parity index derived from $P(r_H)$ successfully characterizes the symmetry-protected topological phase and its transition. Our work establishes configuration space geometry as a novel perspective on quantum criticality, revealing how macroscopic universal phenomena are encoded within its global statistical features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.</description>

      <title>Ge as an orbitronic platform: giant orbital Hall effect</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for orbitronic materials displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system with inversion symmetry. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric Switching of Magnetic Order in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic order. In rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, the angular momentum that breaks TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature at the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (R6G), achieved without the introduction of a moir\'e superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of R6G. Our findings present crystalline R6G as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insights into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</description>

      <title>Encoding a topological gauge theory on a ring-shaped Raman-coupled Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological gauge theories constitute a framework for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter in terms of weakly interacting composite degrees of freedom. Their topological properties become evident when these theories are realized on a space of non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a scheme to realize a one-dimensional topological gauge theory, the chiral BF theory, on a ring geometry. We obtain such a theory by dimensionally reducing Chern-Simons theory on a disk to the so-called chiral BF theory defined on the ring. Then, we encode the theory into a Hamiltonian with a coupling between angular momentum and density, and we propose and numerically benchmark its realization in an optically-dressed Bose gas confined in a ring-shaped trap. There, the topological properties of the underlying theory manifest themselves through a magnetic flux variable that is density-dependent. We quantify such density-dependent magnetic flux in terms of the ground-state angular momentum and the chiral properties of the system through a Bogoliubov analysis. Our proposal enables the observation of the interplay between the topology of the theory and that of the space.</description>

      <title>Coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid in mechanical nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.</description>

      <title>Local thermodynamic DOS measurement and twist-angle mapping in graphene-hBN superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arising from twisted van der Waals stacks fundamentally reshape their electronic properties, enabling band-structure engineering that has driven rapidly growing interest in this field. In studying electronic properties, however, structural disorder present in real devices often leads to twist-angle inhomogeneity and obscures angle-dependent electronic effects when measured with bulk-averaged measurements. Probes that can access local thermodynamic response of the electronic systems with high sensitivity would be highly valuable. Here, we adopt Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally investigate graphene-hBN superlattices. By additionally modulating the chemical potential of the system, we obtain the inverse compressibility with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS. From this information, we determine the local twist angle along the device and find that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain features. Furthermore, by simultaneously tracking the offsets in the contact potential difference and in the net charge, we identify which interface within the heterostructure hosts the trapped bubbles. This capability to identify local electro-chemical environments provides a practical tool for strain-based studies and future device designs utilizing nanoscale engineering in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast symmetry modulation and induced magnetic excitation in the Kagome metal RbV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, yet the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler cooling, state preparation, and optical trapping of a triel atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern ultracold quantum science experiments in optical traps. Reaching this regime typically requires atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and confined in a laser field. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we trap indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</description>
