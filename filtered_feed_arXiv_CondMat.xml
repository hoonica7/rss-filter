      <title>Collective excitations and divergent spin currents in non-centrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective modes in a non-centrosymmetric superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling under laser irradiation. The concept of Anderson Pseudospin Resonance allows to reveal how laser driving gives rise not only to the established resonant enhancement of the third harmonic response, but also to a resonant enhancement in the second harmonic response of the spin current. We propose a theory which explains the phenomenon without including interband transitions. The theory is corroborated by numerical simulations which incorporate interband effects and allow us to clarify the signatures of the collective modes in the long-time dynamics of the superconductor.</description>

      <title>Marginal Fermi liquids from Fermi surfaces coupled via matrix boson gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of metallic critical point which we study at $T=0$ in the large-$N$ limit. We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with $N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact with each other via slave-boson like interaction $\int b_{ij}^{\dagger} \, c_i^{\dagger}f_j$. The bosons have a bare dispersion of $\varepsilon_{\textbf{q}}^b = \lambda_z |\textbf{q}|^z$ and we study the problem in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic self energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the fermionic self energy $\Sigma(i\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson self energy $\Pi(\textbf{q}, i\nu) \propto |\nu|/|\textbf{q}|$ and find that $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker dependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$ Ising-nematic models. Then we evaluate $\Sigma(i\omega)$ again using a more precise form of $\Pi$ which allows us to study the interplay between $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit for which $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(1/|\omega|)$, and the $\omega \rightarrow 0$ limit where we recover $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$. We also use the full bosonic self energy to obtain the correction to the bosonic specific heat as $\frac{T}{N} \ln(1/T)$. Since there are $N^2$ bosons and $N$ fermions, the bulk heat capacity for both fermions and bosons show nearly similar functional form $NVT \ln(N/T)$ and $NVT \ln(1/T)$ respectively for $T \rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Current Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy of Majorana Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode (MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin Coating: Homogeneous All-Inorganic Perovskite Films via High-Pressure Recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of sublattice particle-hole asymmetry in monolayer FeSe superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors, the two Fe atoms in the unit cell are typically related by crystal symmetries; therefore, we expect no intra-unit cell variations in the superconducting gap. However, recent experiments have challenged this expectation, reporting intra-unit cell variations in the gap with an unusual particle-hole asymmetry. Here, we examine the origin of this asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$. We reveal that, in addition to the substrate-induced broken inversion symmetry, substrate nematic symmetry breaking is key to observing this asymmetry. We further identify two possible mechanisms through which this can occur. The first is through an odd-parity gap function that coexists with an extended $s$-wave function. The second is via a nodeless $d$-wave gap function that develops in the presence of a symmetry-breaking substrate. We argue that the latter mechanism is more physical. To test our theory, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements across the nematic domain walls, which exhibit a clear enhancement of the asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices. In addition, we reveal that the observed sublattice particle-hole asymmetry is associated with odd-frequency pairing correlations, providing an experimental realization of this unusual pairing correlation.</description>

      <title>Embedding independent length scale of flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting flat-band materials.</description>

      <title>Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV and $\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$&lt;$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron is attributed to negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$|\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semi-metal.</description>

      <title>Hybridization Gap and Edge States in Strain-layer InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb Quantum Spin Hall Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybridization gap in strained-layer InAs/InxGa1-xSb quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) is significantly enhanced compared to binary InAs/GaSb QSHI structures, where the typical indium composition, x, ranges between 0.2 and 0.4. This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW. Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Non-perturbative Many-Body Approaches in the Exactly Solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$, and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly correlated regimes.</description>

Abstract: We report the results of resistance measurements under pressure up to $4.2\,\mathrm{GPa}$ on single-crystalline $\mathrm{CaSb}_2$ , which shows the maximum of superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. At room temperature, $R(P)$ shows a subtle anomaly at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. However, Bloch-Gr\"uneisen analysis of $R(T)$ indicates that the electronic state does not change significantly across $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Phase Evolution and Optoelectronic Properties of Lead-free Halide Perovskite Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, and optical properties of Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ have been investigated under high pressure using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and optical absorption measurements. At ambient conditions, Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ crystallizes in the cubic Fm-3m structure, which remains stable below 8.0 GPa. Within this pressure range, subtle inter-octahedral rotations develop, producing a gradual localized deviation from the ideal cubic framework. This local reorientation facilitates radiative recombination, leading to a pronounced enhancement of PL intensity with pressure up to 2.4 GPa. Beyond this pressure point, enhancement of nonradiative relaxation channels result in gradual PL quenching. Additionally, the PL intensity increases upon the application of an external weak magnetic field. A structural transition to the orthorhombic Pnnm phase occurs at around 8.0 GPa, followed by a monoclinic P$2_1/m$ phase above 10.7 GPa, and eventual amorphization beyond 25.5 GPa. Optical absorption spectra reveal continuous band-gap narrowing upon compression. These findings demonstrate the strong coupling among lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and optical response in Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$, underscoring its potential as a pressure-tunable optoelectronic material</description>

      <title>Multi-Particle Quantum Walks in a Dipole-Conserving Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Charge glass from supercooling topological-ordered liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological order characterizes a class of quantum and classical many-body liquid states that escape the conventional classification by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Many properties of the topological-ordered states still await a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of them. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with nucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding nucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal that the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a fundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by a global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call a flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a triangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the phase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is required to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the topological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must spend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the system, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of triplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually small Avrami exponent $\sim0.5$. These anomalous dynamics are specific to the crystallization from topological-ordered liquid, and well account for the main features of charge glass behavior exhibited by the organic conductors, $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X(SCN)$_4$.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between topological materials and local symmetry breaking gives rise to diverse topological quantum phenomena. A notable example is the parity anomalous semimetal (PAS), which hosts a single unpaired gapless Dirac cone with a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. Here, we realize this phase in a magnetic topological sandwich structure by applying an in-plane magnetic field. This configuration aligns the magnetization of one surface in-plane while preserving magnetization out-of-plane on the opposite surface, satisfying the condition for a gapless surface state near the Fermi level on only one surface. Our key evidence is a distinctive two-stage evolution of the conductivity tensor ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{xx}$). The first stage culminates in the PAS at the fixed point ($\frac{e^2}{2h}$, $m \frac{e^2}{h}$), where $m \approx 0.6$ corresponds to the minimal longitudinal conductivity of a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions on a 2D lattice. This PAS state remains stabilized and is superposed with a gapped band flow in the second stage. This observation demonstrates that this state stabilized by the in-plane field resists localization--contrary to conventional expectations for 2D electron systems with broken time reversal symmetry. The dynamic transition from an integer quantized insulator to a half-integer quantized semimetal establishes this material system as a versatile platform for exploring parity anomaly physics.</description>

      <title>Non-altermagnetic spin texture in MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnets have emerged as promising candidates in spintronics, uniquely combining large spin-polarized electronic states with zero net magnetization. A prominent example is $\alpha$-MnTe, whose altermagnetic spin splitting, i.e., the degeneracy lift in momentum space induced by collinear magnetic order, has been experimentally observed. However, the direct evidence of its $g$-wave spin polarization, the key property for altermagnetic spintronics, is thus far lacking. By combining high-resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) with first-principles calculations, we reveal a $k_z$-independent, Rashba-like spin texture in $\alpha$-MnTe. Our results indicate that the observed spin polarization is primarily governed by spin-orbit coupling, whereas the magnetic order contributes to the splitting of energy bands but plays a much less dominant role in spin polarization due to the multi-domain nature. From this result, we further establish a way to prescreen altermagnet candidates that favor the formation of large antiferromagnetic domains based on symmetry analysis. Our work elucidates the interplay between magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling in governing spin polarization in altermagnet candidates, and thereby advances the materials design paradigm for spin-functional devices.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer \ce{FeCl2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic \ce{FeCl2} monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Structure-property relation in the cuprates: a possible explanation for the pseudogap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structure-property relation that could be key to the pseudogap phenomenology in cuprates. The underlying nonsymmorphic crystal structure in the low-temperature orthogonal phase endows the lattice with a sublattice structure that gives rise to two electronic bands near the Fermi surface. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the hybridization of these two bands generates small Fermi pockets and, correspondingly, a change in the number of free carriers. A sublattice structure also leads to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) matrix-element interference, naturally explaining the emergence of Fermi arcs and their consistency with closed Fermi pockets. We employ a symmetry analysis to highlight the expected Fermi surface properties, and complement it with density functional theory (DFT) for a quantitative discussion and comparison with recent experiments in doped La$_2$CuO$_4$. The proposed mechanism can consistently account for the most salient features of the pseudogap in the cuprates, namely, the Fermi surface reconstruction with the formation of small Fermi pockets and the corresponding change in carrier density, and the observation of Fermi arcs by ARPES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear absorption spectrum of excitons in TMDC monolayers under the influence of an in-plane magnetic field is theoretically studied. We demonstrate that in-plane magnetic fields induce a hybridization between spin-bright and spin-dark exciton transitions, resulting in a brightening of spin-dark excitons. We analytically investigate spectral features including resonance energy shifts, broadening and amplitudes ratios. In particular, for a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with radiatively-limited linewidth, we find a complex interplay of dark-bright splitting and linewidth difference of both involved spin-bright and spin-dark excitons.</description>

      <title>Noises in a two-channel charge Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance $G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm.</description>

      <title>Model for charge-carriers spectra in topological semimetals of TaAs family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a four-bands model describing the electron energy spectra near the Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex band-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: ground state and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in which the electron hopping amplitude is modulated by the difference between neighboring phonon coordinates. Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases, as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with other electron-phonon systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and theoretically study minimal models of all N\'{e}el ordered collinear antiferromagnets which show the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. Examples of N\'{e}el ordered ferrimagnet and of Dzyaloshinskii's weak ferromagnet are given. Turov's invariants of existence of the magnetization in N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnets for proposed systems are analyzed. As a result, we obtain that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for certain directions of the N\'{e}el order defined by the crystal lattice symmetries. We derive the mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets to be the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the N\'{e}el order, and the spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken symmetries that allowed for the Turov's invariant in the system.</description>

      <title>Majorana string simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in two-dimensional lattice fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic NISPT Phases, igNISPT Phases, and Mixed Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in (1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic perturbation theory of the exact factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel nonadiabatic perturbation theory (NAPT) for correlated systems of electrons and nuclei beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. The essence of the method is to exploit the smallness of the electronic-to-nuclear mass ratio by treating the electron-nuclear correlation terms in the electronic equation of motion of the exact factorisation (EF) framework as perturbation. We prove that any finite-order truncation of the NAPT preserves the normalisation of the conditional electronic factor as well as the gauge covariance of the resulting perturbative equations of motion. We illustrate the usefulness of NAPT by obtaining nonadiabatic corrections to the BO Berry phase in Jahn--Teller systems with a conical intersection. It well captures the departure of the exact Berry phase from being topological via the lowest-order NAPT. By removing the conical intersection with a constant gap, it further yields the correct scaling of the Berry phase toward zero.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Electron Emission from Graphene-Insulator-Semiconductor-Structured Electron Source Utilizing Interference Efficets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graphene-insulator-semiconductor-structured electron source has garnered significant attention due to its high electron emission efficiency and highly monochromatic electron emission. Graphene, with its c-axis orientation and well-defined interlayer spacing, exhibits electron interference effects that can influence the properties of emitted electrons. In this work, motion of an electron wave packet is numerically calculated to discuss the energy spread of the zero-order and first-order diffracted electron waves by mono- and multilayer graphene. It is found that the effects of multiple reflections of electron between the layers broaden the energy spread especially for the incident energy of 13.4 eV, and that highly monochromatic electron emission can be achieved by using diffracted electron wave with a small aperture.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bell Phase in an Electro-Nanomechanical Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspended carbon nanotubes hosting electrostatically defined quantum dots allow for exceptionally strong and tunable electromechanical coupling as well as mechanical modes that can reach the quantum ground state of motion simply by cryogenic cooling. This makes them a unique platform for quantum simulation of electron-phonon coupling. Here, we propose an experimentally realisable setup with two such carbon nanotubes in parallel, each hosting four quantum dots. Our system not only exhibits phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction, but also supports a robust, maximally entangled Bell phase at mesoscopic scales shared across the subsystems. These features highlight its potential as a simulator of strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Witt and Morita equivalences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a family of new equivalence relations among fusion categories that are less refined than the usual Morita equivalence. We obtain abelian groups by quotienting these new equivalence relations from the commutative monoids of the equivalence classes of all fusion categories. Moreover, we upgrade them to equivalence relations among nondegenerate braided fusion categories that are more refined than the usual Witt equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain new abelian groups that are more refined than the usual Witt group. These new groups allow us to access the internal structures within Witt classes. We expect that they are useful in the classification program of (braided) fusion (higher) categories and in the study of gapless edges of 2+1D topological orders.</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy and flow of information in two-skyrmion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Sliding and superlubric moir\'e twisting ferroelectric transition in HfO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues like high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 9.57 meV/f.u. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moir\'e patterns, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. The in-plane (out-of-plane) polarization values for HfO2 at twist angles of 21.79{\deg}, 27.80{\deg}, and 46.83{\deg} are 430 (5.82), 367 (2.20), and 1057 (0.03) pC/m, respectively. For 21.79{\deg} and 27.80{\deg} twisting, switching barriers drop to 1.74 and 0.18 meV/f.u., indicating superlubric-like transitions. Notably, the 46.83{\deg} twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.03 meV /f.u.), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moir\'e-engineered switching route for 2D ferroelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the B\"uttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that for compensated N\'{e}el order the non-zero thermal Hall effect will occur inthe absence of any symmetry between the two magnetic sublattices, thus making the system ferrimagnetic. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two magnetic sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.</description>

      <title>Optical Controllable Spin-Polarization in Two Dimensional Altermagnets via Robust Spin-Momentum Locking Excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-momentum locking (SML) excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors are appealing to programmable optical control of spin-polarized carriers in ultrafast spintronics. To address the current thirsty for long-lived excitons with zero-external-field stability and room-temperature spin-polarization, we hereby predict the existence of intrinsically SML excitons in altermagnetic V$_2 X_2$O ($X=$ S, Se) driven by giant non-relativistic spin-splittings ($&gt;$ 1.2 eV). First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature. Our work provides a new paradigm for SML exciton physics via the novel altermagnetism, opening up new possibilities for all-optical manipulation in advanced opto-spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a static approximation can be valid and that the moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth can be a good tool to find the value of the static interaction. We also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics.</description>

Abstract: We develop and formalize a phase diagnostic based on the information-distance \(d_E = K_0/\sqrt{I}\) (mutual information \(I\)) for 1D quantum chains. Calibrating with the Euclidean benchmark \(I(r)\propto r^{-2}\mapsto d_E(r)\propto r\) makes the triangle-inequality test parameter-free and scale-invariant. Under site-averaged, monotone scaling conditions on the 1D line we establish a criterion linking the decay of \(I(r)\) to metric behavior of \(d_E(r)\): power laws \(I(r)\sim r^{-X}\) with \(0&lt;X\le 2\) yield subadditivity (metric scaling), while exponential clustering leads to superadditivity. As an analytic check complementing our earlier numerical study, we verify these predictions in the 1D transverse-field Ising chain using an exact Jordan-Wigner/Bogoliubov-de Gennes solution: at criticality \(I(r)\) follows a power law close to the \(X=2\) benchmark and the equal-legs triangle defect \(\Delta(r,r)=d_E(2r)-2d_E(r)\) is asymptotically non-positive; in gapped regimes \(I(r)\) decays exponentially and \(\Delta(r,r)\gg 0\). The result is a practical, falsifiable large-scale diagnostic based solely on site-averaged two-site mutual information.</description>

      <title>Bipartite entanglement and surface criticality: The extra contribution of non-ordinary edge in entanglement</title>

Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is consistent with a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out that only the ordinary bipartition purely reflects the criticality of the bulk; otherwise, the extra gapless edge mode will also contribute to the entanglement. We have demonstrated that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still approximately persists even at a bulk-gapless point, thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy. Our results establish that boundary conditions induced by the cut are decisive for entanglement-based probes and provide practical protocols to separate bulk from boundary contributions.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transition and high-order van Hove singularity in twisted double bilayer WSe${}_2$: mean-field and functional renormalization group study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir'e semiconductors can realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states. Based on a continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's band structure, focusing on the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity, which can be accessed by gate tuning. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave. Finally, we employ a functional renormalization group approach to also study the competition between density-wave and superconducting instabilities. For twist angles of $\theta=2.0^\circ, 2.5^\circ$, as well as $\theta\approx 3.5^\circ$ -- where the high-order van Hove-singularity is found -- we find clear indications for unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.</description>

      <title>Local Exchange-Correlation Potentials by Density Inversion in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Implementation of Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Correlated Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and computational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science.</description>

      <title>Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.</description>
