      <title>Topolectrical circuit theory and realizations of topological, non-linear, and non-Hermitian phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical circuits offer a unique platform to explore physical phenomena, from topology to non-Hermitian effects. Investigations of the fundamental properties of this metamaterial platform are crucial to distinguish observed/measured quantities from intrinsic circuit responses. In this thesis, we delve into the analysis of voltage and impedance responses and their role in unveiling complex dynamics and profound physical principles. We reveal that even the simplest one-dimensional circuits exhibit intriguing voltage profiles. Our study of multi-dimensional and multi-structural lattice models shows size-dependent impedance responses, which challenge our current textbook knowledge. Building on these insights, we will present non-linear and non-Hermitian circuit applications, showcasing how electrical circuits provide a suitable platform for realizing intriguing physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nematic and partially polarized phases in rhombohedral graphene with varying number of layers: An extensive Hartree-Fock Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene systems with different number of layers feature an abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of the correlated phases for varying number of layers could be useful to interpret the experimental observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree-Fock calculations have been performed to build the phase diagram of rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene for different number of layers, in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can present nematicity, stabilized by electron-electron interactions, exhibiting rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping, and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin-orbit coupling proximity effects has been studied. Our results offer new insights into the role of correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems which will motivate future experimental and theoretical works.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary transition at the edge of a correlated topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with zig-zag edges and the Hubbard U-term tuned to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the two phases giving potential experimental signatures.</description>

      <title>Band mixing effects in one-dimensional charge transfer insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are governed by the electrons occupying strongly correlated $d$-orbitals that are hybridized with surrounding ligand oxygen $p$ orbitals to varying degrees. Their physics is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal (TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$, and on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a function of $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results spanning from the Mott insulating ($\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &gt; U$) to negative charge transfer regime $\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &lt; 0$ to better understand the ground and momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interfacial Quantum Dipoles in Charge Transfer Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteretic gate responses of two-dimensional material heterostructures serve as sensitive probes of the underlying electronic states and hold significant promise for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices. Here we identify a new mechanism of hysteretic behavior in graphene/$h$BN/$\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ charge transfer field effect devices. The hysteresis loop exhibits a sharp onset under low temperatures and evolves symmetrically relative to the charge transfer equilibrium. Unlike conventional flash memory devices, the charge transfer heterostructure features a transparent tunneling barrier and its hysteretic gate response is induced by the dynamic tuning of interfacial dipoles originating from quantum exchange interactions. The system acts effectively as a ferroelectric and gives rise to remarkable tunability of the hysteretic gate response under external electrical bias. Our work unveils a novel mechanism for engineering hysteretic behaviors via dynamic interfacial quantum dipoles.</description>

      <title>Magnetism at the interface of $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism in doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and van der Waals interfaced materials have motivated the search for sustainable magnetic states at the nanoscale with the prospect of building devices for spintronics applications. In this study, we report the existence of magnetism in a heterostructure made up of an $MoSe_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer and a $V_2O_5$ substrate. Using density functional theory simulations, we find that ferromagnetic ordering can be found in the $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructure even though the individual components are nonmagnetic. By examining the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this system we find how the occurring ferromagnetism evolves if the transition metal dichalcogenide or the $V_2O_5$ substrate can host point defects. Our study suggests that the balance between charge transfer and spin reorganization can lead to interface magnetism in novel hybrid materials.</description>

      <title>Sliding two-dimensional superconductivity and charge-density-wave state in a bulk crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the two-dimensional (2D) limit is a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena-many of which remain elusive in their 3D counterparts. While studies of 2D superconductivity have predominantly focused on mono- or few-layer systems, we demonstrate an alternative route-interlayer sliding in bulk crystals. Through a precisely controlled growth strategy, we engineer interlayer sliding in bulk 3R-NbSe2, deliberately disrupting [001] mirror symmetry and drastically suppressing interlayer coupling. Remarkably, this structural manipulation stabilizes Ising-type superconductivity coexisting with an unconventional charge-density-wave (CDW) state akin to that of monolayer 2H-NbSe2. The sliding phase exhibits a pronounced suppression of the upper critical field at low temperatures, revealing a delicate competition between Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the globally noncentrosymmetric lattice. Intriguingly, the superconducting state displays two-fold symmetry, a signature that may arise from asymmetric SOC or a multi-component pairing order parameter. Our work establishes interlayer sliding as a symmetry-breaking tool to promote 2D superconductivity in bulk materials-without resorting to extrinsic intercalation or doping. More broadly, this approach sets a paradigm for unlocking hidden quantum states in layered materials, offering a new dimension in design of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Mixed spin states for robust ferromagnetism in strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration, distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Opto- and magneto-tunable exceptional degeneracies in non-Hermitian ferromagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional $p$-wave magnets (UPMs) with odd-parity spin textures have attracted interest for their zero net magnetization and anisotropic spin-split Fermi surfaces. Here, we explore a non-Hermitian open quantum system composed of a ferromagnet and a UPM, subjected to an external magnetic field and off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL), serving as tunable control parameters. We demonstrate the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the proposed junction, whose locations can be modulated by the intrinsic properties of the UPM. These EPs exhibit different multiplicities and formation conditions compared to those in even-parity magnets (dubbed $d$- wave altermagnets), a distinction attributable to the preserved time-reversal and broken inversion symmetries characteristic of UPMs. We find that both the unidirectional magnetic field (with adjustable strength and orientation) and the CPL induce momentum-direction-dependent modifications to the EPs, such as their shifting, tilting, merging, or annihilation, supported by analyses of spin projection and eigenvector overlap. Although both perturbations influence the EP structure, they operate via distinct mechanisms: CPL induces a global Floquet re-normalization, enabling dynamic tunability through light, whereas the unidirectional magnetic field selectively alters orientation-aligned terms, lacking such tunability. Beyond revealing EP dynamics in UPM-based junctions, our results highlight UPMs as promising platforms for non-Hermitian phenomena in future spintronics.</description>

      <title>Unified description of cuprate superconductors by fractionalized electrons emerging from integrated analyses of photoemission spectra and quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Transport in Single Quantum Dots: A Review from Linear Response to Nonlinear Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Local interface effects modulate global charge order and optical properties of 1T-TaS$_2$/1H-WSe$_2$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1T-TaS$_2$ is a layered charge density wave (CDW) crystal exhibiting sharp phase transitions and associated resistance changes. These resistance steps could be exploited for information storage, underscoring the importance of controlling and tuning CDW states. Given the importance of out-of-plane interactions in 1T-TaS$_2$, modulating interlayer interactions by heterostructuring is a promising method for tailoring CDW phase transitions. In this work, we investigate the optical and electronic properties of heterostructures comprising 1T-TaS$_2$ and monolayer 1H-WSe$_2$. By systematically varying the thickness of 1T-TaS$_2$ and its azimuthal alignment with 1H-WSe$_2$, we find that intrinsic moir\'e strain and interfacial charge transfer introduce CDW disorder in 1T-TaS$_2$ and modify the CDW ordering temperature. Furthermore, our studies reveal that the interlayer alignment impacts the exciton dynamics in 1H-WSe$_2$, indicating that heterostructuring can concurrently tailor the electronic phases in 1T-TaS$_2$ and the optical properties of 1H-WSe$_2$. This work presents a promising approach for engineering optoelectronic behavior of heterostructures that integrate CDW materials and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals: A Hyperspatial Projective Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected, momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments, has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that interaction-induced N\'eel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and $h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting, which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant Fields Inducing Energy Towers in Lieb Quantum Spin Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg model on a Lieb lattice. A set of exact eigenstates is constructed based on the restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) when a resonant staggered magnetic field is applied. These states are identical to the eigenstates of a system of two coupled angular momenta. Furthermore, we find that the RSGA can be applied to other eigenstates of the Lieb lattice in an approximate manner. Numerical simulations reveal that there exist sets of eigenstates, which obey a quasi-RSGA. These states act as energy towers within the low-lying excited spectrum, indicating that they are quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Using surface plasmons to detect spin inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that spin dynamics may acquire an inertial effect in a few metallic magnets, deviating from the traditional inertia-free dynamics. It remains an open question to ascertain the physical mechanisms and universality of the spin inertia across diverse magnetic systems. Here, we show that spin inertia generates nutation spin waves in the terahertz regime, which can hybridize with the surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) conducting materials such as graphene. By exciting hybrid spin wave-plasmon modes and analyzing the reflection spectrum of a 2D material$|$magnet heterostructure, we propose a method to quantitatively determine the strength of spin inertia in magnetic layers. Our approach is universally applicable to all types of magnetic insulators and could advance the future exploration of the magnitude and physical mechanism of spin inertia.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model in the canonical ensemble: a beyond mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without external trapping potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Focused Ion Beam patterning of MnSb(1-101) based spintronic devcies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low temperature transport measurements are presented of ferromagnetic MnSb devices with the magnetic properties patterned using a Ga focused ion beam FIB system at 30 keV. FIB patterning introduces disorder and this is quantified in this paper through measurements of the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity. The MnSb structural phase is the niccolite phase with a surface state in addition to bulk states. FIB doses up to 1E16 Ga ions per square cm reduces the anisotropic magnetoresistance signal but increases the size of the anomalous Hall effect signal in out of plane magnetic fields, B. The anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity is e squared divided by h in the undamaged devices, where e is the electronic charge and h is Plancks constant. This quantity is sensitive to the level of disorder induced by the Ga ion beam, reducing to zero at dose levels greater than 1E16 Ga ions per square cm. The resistivity shows a logarithmic B dependence after the magnetization has saturated with the low field anisotropic magnetoresistance contribution of 0.12 percent. The conductivity change is e squared divided by h in the magnetic field range of logarithmic B behavior. The resistivity shows a reduced fit to a logarithmic B dependence at high FIB dose levels and is dependent on the damage uniformity. Patterning nanostructured magnetic behavior in MnSb, with compatibility to altermagnetic materials, in particular the niccolite phase of CrSb and non trivial Berry phase contributions to transport make this ferromagnetic material and patterning technique useful for future spintronic device development.</description>

      <title>Exploring Weak Turbulence of Phonon and Magnon Beams in Magneto-Acoustic Ultrathin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a simple theoretical model describing narrow envelope surface acoustic waves
  (phonons) and spin waves (magnons) in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Based on the general
  principles of weak wave turbulence, the model considers interactions between beams of an ideal
  phonon gas and a weakly non-ideal magnon gas, which represent magnetoacoustic oscillations in
  the system. Equations for the wave envelopes of phonons and magnons, along with their harmonics,
  are derived, incorporating nonlinear effects from three- and four-particle interactions. In
  the general non-resonant case, linear stationary envelope simulations are sufficient. These clarify
  the experimentally observed angular dependence of the transmitted acoustic signal with respect
  to the orientation of the magnetic field. The study highlights increased energy losses associated
  with enhanced magnetoacoustic coupling. Given the broad interdisciplinary interest in weak turbulence
  phenomena within condensed matter physics and nonlinear wave dynamics, our model
  offers significant predictive capabilities and greatly simplifies calculations of quasiparticle beam
  interactions.</description>

      <title>Advanced SQUID-on-lever scanning probe for high-sensitivity magnetic microscopy with sub-100-nm spatial resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are exceptionally sensitive magnetometers capable of detecting weak magnetic fields. Miniaturizing these devices and integrating them onto scanning probes enables high-resolution imaging at low-temperature. Here, we fabricate nanometer-scale niobium SQUIDs with inner-loop sizes down to 10 nm at the apex of individual planar silicon cantilevers via a combination of wafer-scale optical lithography and focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling. These robust SQUID-on-lever probes overcome many of the limitations of existing devices, achieving spatial resolution better than 100 nm, magnetic flux sensitivity of $0.3~\mu\Phi_0/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, and operation in magnetic fields up to about 0.5 T at 4.2 K. Nanopatterning via Ne- or He-FIB allows for the incorporation of a modulation line for coupling magnetic flux into the SQUID or a third Josephson junction for shifting its phase. Such advanced functionality, combined with high spatial resolution, large magnetic field range, and the ease of use of a cantilever-based scanning probe, extends the applicability of scanning SQUID microscopy to a wide range of magnetic, normal conducting, superconducting, and quantum Hall systems. We demonstrate magnetic imaging of skyrmions at the surface of bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Analysis of the point spread function determined from imaging a single skyrmion yields a full-width-half-maximum of 87 nm. Moreover, we image modulated magnetization patterns with a period of 65 nm.</description>

      <title>Orbital Inverse Faraday and Cotton-Mouton Effects in Hall Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall (QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH fluid.</description>

      <title>From trigonal to triclinic: Symmetry-tuned Rashba effects in buckled honeycomb SrHfO$_{3}$-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb (SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R = 29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.</description>

      <title>Topological phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking: the revenge of the original Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological properties in interacting one-dimensional models. We solve these models using bozonization and identify topologically non-trivial phases by counting the additional degeneracy (affiliated with the edge modes) of a finite-size system relative to the infinite one. We find even if the mean-field solution is topological, this may not be true when it arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking, including in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This implies that the original SSH model, as presented by Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger, is topologically trivial, as opposed to its mean-field version. A spinful version, on the other hand, does exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase. In that state, both mean-field solutions are topologically non-trivial and correspond to non-interacting SSH chains in the opposite phases with the winding number $\nu=1$. We show that this phase is protected by a chiral symmetry, similar to the non-interacting phases.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</description>

      <title>A Clarification on Quantum-Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder effects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.</description>

Abstract: Multifold fermions, quasiparticles with multiple degeneracy protected by crystalline symmetries, exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena stemming from their large topological charges and unique band structures. A comprehensive understanding of their response to external stimuli remains challenging, especially for types protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries where various degrees of freedom are intricately coupled. Here, we systematically construct effective models for multifold fermions that incorporate external fields based on crystalline symmetry. Specifically, we develop a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the threefold fermion protected by space group I2$_1$3 (No.~199) in the presence of spin--orbit coupling, and derive the terms for external fields. By complementing this with a tight-binding model, we investigate the magnetic field response and reveal the pair annihilation of magnetic monopoles. Furthermore, we construct a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the eightfold fermion in space group P$\bar{4}3n1'$ (No.~218), including its coupling to external fields. This work provides a robust theoretical foundation for advancing the study of external field responses and transport phenomena in multifold fermions, opening new avenues to explore their rich physics.</description>

      <title>Inertial Imaging of Dual Mass Distributions on a Graphene Nanodrum: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the possibility for inertial imaging of spatially patterned annular mass distributions of a circular graphene nanodrum resonator. By placing two distinct analytes in concentric annular regions, we harness the vibrational mode-specific sensitivities of the nanodrum to estimate their respective mass densities. An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz principle is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts. Finite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the shifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying geometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency shifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass distributions of annular rings. The results indicate that the estimation errors are lower for analytes placed near the antinodal regions of the dominant vibration mode, with the lowest error being 1.82 % for analyte A and 2.03 % for analyte B. Furthermore, thinner annular rings demonstrate enhanced detection accuracy due to reduced modal overlap. This study demonstrates an analytical strategy for mass detection using a graphene nanodrum by providing insights into optimal analyte placement and structural design for high-precision multi-target mass sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Skyrmion Qudit in a Triangular-lattice magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Ground State of Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$: The Crucial Role of Frustrated Zigzag Chains Revealed by Inelastic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on the magnetically frustrated $S=\frac12$ sawtooth-chain compound atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ featuring inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. Transverse to the sawtooth chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75 meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize atacamite's low-energy magnetism.</description>

      <title>Orientational Effects in the Low Pair Continuum of Aluminium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the predictions of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of ambient polycrystalline aluminium from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in the pair continuum regime to recent ultrahigh resolution x-ray Thomson scattering measurements, collected at the European XFEL. TDDFT predicts strong anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.</description>

      <title>Cavity-QED-controlled two-dimensional Moir\'e Excitons without twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an all-optical Moir\'e-like exciton confinement by means of spatially periodic optical cavities. Such periodic photonic structures can control the material properties by coupling the matter excitations to the confined photons and their quantum fluctuations. We develop a low energy non-perturbative quantum electro-dynamical description of strongly coupled excitons and photons at finite momentum transfer. We find that in the classical limit of a laser driven cavity the induced optical confinement directly emulates Moir\'e physics. In a dark cavity instead, the sole presence of quantum fluctuations of light generates a sizable renormalization of the excitonic bands and effective mass. We attribute these effects to long-range cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions which can only be captured in a non-perturbative treatment. With these findings we propose spatially structured cavities as a promising avenue for cavity material engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization in a dimerized J1-J2 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization ({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization, the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization, making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and control of spin currents are crucial for advancing next-generation spintronic technologies. These technologies depend on materials capable of efficiently sourcing and interconverting spin and charge currents, while overcoming some limitations associated with conventional ferromagnets and heavy metals. Kagome topological antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals, such as Mn$_3$Sn, present unique advantages owing to their distinct magnetic order and significant Berry curvature-driven transport phenomena. In this study, we systematically investigate spin current generation and spin-to-charge conversion phenomena in epitaxial (0001)-oriented Mn$_3$Sn thin films. Our findings reveal a spin Hall angle of 0.9$\%$ and a nearly isotropic in-plane spin Hall conductivity of 44.4~($\hbar$/e) $\Omega^{-1}$.cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature, originating from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as discussed in light of first-principle calculations. Furthermore, in Mn$_3$Sn(0001)/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ heterostructures, we observe a high spin-mixing conductance of 28.52 nm$^{-2}$ and an interfacial spin-transparency of approximately 72$\%$. Notably, we also find that the spin diffusion length in Mn$_3$Sn(0001) epitaxial films exceeds 15 nm at room temperature. Our results highlight the potential of the topological Weyl noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn as an efficient material for spin transport and conversion in prospective spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splitting remain largely unexplored. Here, based on symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ergodicity of Worldvolume HMC via embedding Generalized-thimble HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times 6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).</description>

      <title>Classification of Average Crystalline Topological Superconductors through a Generalized Real-Space Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected by exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These phases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected topological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs -- topological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence. Unlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require exact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as the symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state ensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state construction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this generalized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases, and the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the constraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a physically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial symmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our classification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as an independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline topological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections, and they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected phases that have no analog in clean systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating high-temperature superconductivity in moir\'e WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moir\'e WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform for tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moir\'e WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moir\'e unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1, superconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc occurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective Fermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices that can be used to study high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological invariants in strongly interacting many-body systems within holographic mean-field theory (H-MFT) framework. Analytic expressions for retarded Green's functions are obtained for all possible fermionic bilinear interactions in the limit of probe background limit $\mathrm{AdS}_4$, from which we construct topological Hamiltonians. Integrating Berry curvature over the momentum domain for the gapped spectra yields well-defined and quantized Chern numbers, enabling a systematic classification of them across interaction types. These topological invariants remain robust under deformation parameters like interaction and temperature, indicating that H-MFT encodes effective single-particle-state topology near a quantum critical point in strongly correlated systems. We point out why topological number is defined in the holographic theories while it is not in the perturbative field theory.</description>

      <title>Flat bands, Dirac cones, and higher-order band crossings in twisted multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Itinerant Magnetic Domain Wall and Quasiparticle Boundary State in Spin-Density-Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are characterized by reorientation of local spins. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic domain wall structure of the spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we found the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation. This generates a double-Q SDW state, which is further evidenced by an accompanying second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. Interestingly, the screw dislocations induced half vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. The spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls. Remarkably, for the first time we observed the SDW quasiparticle states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new type of domain wall distinct to that of local moment magnetism, with a mechanism rooted in the itinerant nature of SDW.</description>

      <title>Destabilisation of local magnetic anisotropy in heavy-fermion compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that in the presence of orthorhombic or tetragonal symmetry the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory, we also observe that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the quantum pseudospin-1 pyrochlore magnet featuring Fe$^{2+}$-based spinel oxides that addresses the formation of amplitude-modulated spin-density waves. We propose that the relatively small spin-orbit coupling and the small extra crystal field splitting in these materials create anisotropic exchange interactions and strong single-ion anisotropy, respectively, whose interplay becomes the source of quadrupolar moments selectively appearing on certain sublattices, leading to a spatially modulated hybrid of dipolar and quadrupolar moments. This mechanism represents the possibility of insulating magnets to form an exotic phase with coexisting liquid-solid properties.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase Dynamics of Sliding Electron Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a non-vanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system's nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized. As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coupling, Topology, and Chirality by Antimagnons in Magnetic Multilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing novel topological states in magnonic systems unlocks robust, low-power spin-wave devices. In this letter, we show that incorporating left-handed spin waves (antimagnons) fundamentally reorganizes band topology, and enables tunable spin-wave coupling and chirality. We proposed a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger like model, the 2D-SSH4 chain, where dipolar interactions between magnons and antimagnons generate topological bands with nonzero Chern numbers. This framework explains the origin of topological surface states in ferromagnetic multilayer and shows they share the same topological origin as classic magnetostatic surface spin waves. Our model also offers a straightforward framework for designing more complex magnetic multilayer connected by dipolar interactions, such as antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayer. In these dipolar-coupled multilayers, both coherent and dissipative interlayer spin-wave couplings together with the layer resolved chirality, are tunable via external magnetic fields and spin torques. Our results provide a practical platform for topological magnonics, enabling control of magnon chirality and coupling in future devices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as unconventional magnets because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Gate-voltage-driven quantum phase transition at $0.7 (2e^2/h)$ in quantum point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum phase transition (QPT) in quantum point contacts by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent quasiparticle energy at the Fermi level at zero temperature. This energy is computed using the local density of states at the site of the localized spin, which is extracted from the replicated gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance shaped by entangled-state tunneling. The QPT occurs between symmetric ($G \geq 0.7 G_0$) and asymmetric ($G &lt; 0.7 G_0$) Kondo coupling states, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, and is driven by the migration of a localized spin in response to the side-gate voltage. The asymmetric state exhibits two distinct Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The existence of two Kondo temperatures in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ regime accounts for both the anomalous gate-voltage dependence of the zero-bias anomaly width and the inability to define a Kondo temperature in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ region.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial spin texture in a superconducting electron gas revealed by exchange interactions</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic 'half-Rashba' spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function, considering both the case of suppressed magnetization ($m = 0$) and finite magnetization ($m \neq 0$). When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits a clear $60^\circ$ periodicity in its angular dependence, with the locations of maxima and minima consistent with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. A qualitative difference in their temperature dependence is observed: the minima show gap-like behavior that may signal Majorana gap formation due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, while the maxima do not exhibit the expected gapless Majorana fermion signature. In addition, a linear-in-field effect -- distinct from magnetization -- emerges, with the characteristic temperature below which angular dependence appears increasing linearly with the magnetic field. Importantly, this directional dependence becomes quantitatively significant only at very low temperatures. When finite magnetization is included, the angular dependence of the specific heat remains, and the qualitative behavior is similar to the $m = 0$ case: the minima continue to exhibit gap-like features, while the maxima do not show signatures of gapless Majorana fermions. These results suggest that suppressing magnetization alone is insufficient to realize quantum spin liquid behavior in the Kitaev model under a magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with the pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern phase diagrams, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-$1$ system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.</description>

      <title>Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the intensity and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic, resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes.

      <title>Intrinsic layer polarization and multi-flatband transport in non-centrosymmetric mixed-stacked multilayer graphene</title>

Abstract: Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.</description>

      <title>Bath parameterization in multi-band cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable algorithms to solve complex impurity problems are instrumental to a routine use of quantum embedding methods for material discovery. In this context, we employ an efficient selected configuration interaction impurity solver to investigate the role of bath discretization, specifically, bath size and parameterization, in Hamiltonian-based cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for the one- and two-orbital Hubbard models. We consider two- and four-site clusters for the single-orbital model and a two-site cluster for the two-orbital model. Our results demonstrate that, for small bath sizes, the choice of parameterization can significantly influence the solution, highlighting the importance of systematic convergence checks. Comparing different bath parameterizations not only reveals the robustness of a given solution but can also provide insights into the nature of different solutions and potential instabilities of the paramagnetic state. We present an extensive analysis of the zero-temperature Mott transition of the paramagnetic half-filled single-band Hubbard model, benchmarking our findings against previous literature. We find that for the single-band model the dependence on parameterization is weak for the largest bath sizes accessible with ASCI, while a tendency towards a nematic solution can be seen when the bath size is small. Building on this, we extend our study to the multi-band regime, where we present the first systematic analysis at zero temperature for two orbitals and a two-site cluster. This setup allows us to assess the effect of nearest-neighbor dynamical correlations on the multi-orbital Mott transition. In this case, some quantitative dependence on the parameterization is retained for the two-orbital model, for instance in the value of the critical interaction for a Mott transition.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals: An emerging structure-type for anisotropic Kondo lattice studies</title>

Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials are a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr- and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Josephson coupling of d-vectors in triplet superconductors arising from frustrated spin textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that coupling itinerant electrons to a noncollinear classical exchange field can induce anisotropic Josephson coupling between superconducting $d$-vectors, analogous to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism. Using perturbative methods, we analyze an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice. Noncollinear local spin textures generate spin triplet pairing correlations and can favor spatially varying superconducting order due to anisotropic Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors, endowing a ``pliability'' to the pairing order that competes with the superfluid stiffness. For nonunitary pairing, this spatial texture of $d$-vectors can give rise to anomalous vortices in the absence of an external magnetic field. We further predict a Josephson diode effect with efficiency proportional to the spin chirality of the underlying magnetic texture. These results establish a link between frustrated magnetism and spatial textures of triplet superconducting pairing, with implications for a range of materials such as Mn$_3$Ge and $4$Hb-TaS$_2$, where superconductivity can be proximity-induced or intrinsic.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors</title>

Abstract: Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moir\'e materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</description>

      <title>Strain-Controlled Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Number Reversal in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>
