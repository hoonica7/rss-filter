      <title>Electronic Crystal Phases in the Presence of Non-Uniform Berry Curvature and Tunable Berry Flux: The $\lambda_N$-Jellium model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer graphene systems have rekindled interest in electronic crystal phases in two dimensions -- but now for phases enriched by non-trivial quantum geometry. In this work, we introduce a simple continuum model with tunable Berry curvature distribution and total flux, enabling systematic study of crystallization in geometrically nontrivial bands. In the noninteracting limit, the addition of a C6-symmetric periodic potential yields a rich phase diagram, for which we provide several analytical insights. Notably, we derive a general formula for the Chern number in the weak-potential regime that is broadly applicable to single-band projected models. Removing the periodic potential and treating Coulomb interactions self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level, the resulting phase diagrams host a variety of crystalline states, including anomalous Hall crystals, halo Wigner crystals in which localized electrons spontaneously acquire orbital angular momentum leading to depleted electron occupation at the zone center, and a novel halo anomalous Hall crystal that combines these properties with a finite Chern number. We identify why these phases are energetically favorable through analytical and energetic considerations. Our results provide insight into the interplay between crystallization and band geometry, while also offering a simple toy model amenable to numerical methods beyond mean-field.</description>

      <title>Long-lived dynamics of the charge density wave in TiSe$_2$ observed by neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved elastic neutron scattering combined with rapid laser heating was used to probe the charge density wave (CDW) state in 1T-TiSe$_2$, capturing both the melting and reformation of the CDW on long timescales and providing clues on the roles of phonons and excitons. With the laser source on, superlattice Bragg peaks such as (-1.5, -1.5, 1.5) observed below the CDW transition due to the new lattice periodicity, dissipate within 5 seconds, at a rate that is much slower than the sample's thermal response to the heat wave propagation. Whereas the electronic ordering associated with the CDW phase is disrupted rapidly by the laser-induced heating, the periodic lattice distortion (PLD) exhibits a markedly slower evolution during the melting process. This delayed suppression of the PLD relative to the thermal response indicates that CDW melting proceeds through a nonthermal pathway, likely linked to the loss of superlattice phonons such as the soft mode at q = (0.5 ,0, 0.5 ).</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Potentials for Efficient Simulations of Anisotropic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating interactions between non-spherical colloidal particles is computationally challenging due to the complex dependency of forces and energies on their geometry. We introduce and evaluate both descriptor-based and end-to-end models for predicting interaction energies and forces. Then, we compare various descriptors coupled with different regression models, like Behler-Parinello descriptors, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, and neuroevolution potential, as well as multiple end-to-end models, namely SchNet, DimeNet, and DimeNet++. Among these, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) offers an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. NEP, originally developed for atomistic systems, represents interactions between rigid anisotropic bodies using point clouds, which enables the representation of any arbitrary shape. Molecular dynamics simulations using NEP, accurately reproduced structural properties across diverse particle shapes including cubes, tetrahedra, pentagonal bipyramids, and twisted cylinders, while achieving roughly up to an order-of-magnitude speedup over other methods. Additionally, we show that the extension of the method to multi-face shapes with different interactions on their surface is straightforward. We used a twisted cylinder, which lacked any point group symmetry, to demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of NEP. Our approach enables scalable simulations of complex colloidal systems and can potentially help to facilitate efficient studies on shape dependent interactions and phase behavior in the future.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Half-Quantized Chiral Edge Current in a C = 1/2 Parity Anomaly State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single massive Dirac surface band is predicted to exhibit a half-quantized Hall conductance, a hallmark of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state in quantum field theory. Experimental signatures of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state have been observed in semi-magnetic topological insulator (TI) bilayers, yet whether it supports a half-quantized chiral edge current remains elusive. Here, we observe a robust half-quantized Hall conductance plateau in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown asymmetric magnetic TI trilayer under specific in-plane magnetic field regimes, corresponding to the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. Within this state, both nonlocal and nonreciprocal transport signals are greatly enhanced, which we identify as direct evidence for a half-quantized chiral edge current localized at the boundary of the top gapped surface. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this half-quantized chiral edge channel is the essential carrier of the observed half-quantized Hall conductance plateau, analogous to the quantized chiral edge channel in the C = 1 quantum anomalous Hall state. Our results provide experimental evidence for the half-quantized chiral edge transport in a C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. This work establishes asymmetric magnetic TI trilayers as a platform for probing single Dirac fermion physics and paves the way to explore a series of exciting phenomena in the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state, including the topological magnetoelectric effect and quantized magneto-optical response.</description>

      <title>Improving Spectral Resolution from Real-time Evolution for Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of numerically simulated spectra using real-time evolution methods for strongly correlated systems is affected by both the length of simulation time and the system size, limiting resolution in both frequency and momentum. In this work, we propose a computationally cheap, linear autoregressive machine learning-based framework to extend short-time and distance results over a wider range. We demonstrate the proposed method to extend the lesser Green's function for both the Hubbard model and the much more computationally challenging Hubbard-extended Holstein model. This technique significantly improves both the frequency and momentum resolution of the single-particle removal spectrum $\mathcal{A}(k,\omega)$, allowing observation of otherwise obscured spectral features due to electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is a newly discovered magnetic phase, characterized by non-relativistic spin-splitting that has been experimentally observed. Here, we introduce a framework dubbed {\it spin-orbital altermagnetism} to achieve spin-orbital textures in altermagnetic materials. We identify two distinct classes of spin-orbital altermagnetism: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic type emerges from symmetry-compensated magnetic orders with spontaneously broken parity-time symmetry, while the extrinsic type stems from translational-symmetry breaking between sublattices, as exemplified by the Jahn-Teller-driven structural phase transition. In addition to directly measuring the spin-orbital texture, we propose spin conductivity and spin-resolved orbital polarization as effective methods for detecting these altermagnets. Additionally, a symmetry-breaking mechanism induces weak spin magnetization, further revealing the peculiar feature of spin-orbital altermagnetism. We also utilize the staggered susceptibility to illustrate a potential realization of this phase in a two-orbital interacting system. Our work provides a new platform to explore spin-orbital locked physics, extending the materials classes that may display complex spin textures from the standard $4d-5d$ compounds to $3d$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Correlation Effects on Magnetic Structure and Lattice Dynamics of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$, a quadruple perovskite oxide (AA'$_3$B$_4$O$_{12}$-type), has attracted attention for its notable bifunctional activity in oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. Here, we systematically investigate the magnetic phase diagram and lattice dynamics of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ using two density functional theory plus Hubbard U (DFT + U) approaches: the spin-density and the charge-only-density formalism. Phase diagram analysis as a function of U and J shows that both methods stabilize the experimentally observed antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration (C-type AFM at the B-site and ferrimagnetic structure at the A'-site Mn ions) at U = 3.5 eV and J = 0.8 eV. These U and J values are consistent with those obtained from the constrained random phase approximation. Furthermore, we observe the dynamical stability of the AFM phase through phonon dispersion curves and analyze the Raman-active phonon modes. These results highlight the critical role of appropriate U and J parameters in accurately describing the properties of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Excitonic Insulator Signatures in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature phase of Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, a near-zero-gap semiconductor ($E_G$ = 0), is a promising candidate for an excitonic insulator. Given the dome-like evolution expected for an excitonic insulator around $E_G$, we investigated Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, the more semi-metallic Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, and semiconducting Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ using high-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). Our findings reveal a second-order structural phase transition from orthorhombic (space group: $Cmcm$) to monoclinic (space group: $C2/c$) in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$ and Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, but no transition in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ down to 2 K. This transition breaks two mirror symmetries, enabling and enhancing the hybridization of Ta, Ni, and Se atoms, shortening bond lengths, and strengthening orbital interactions. NEXAFS data confirm stronger hybridization, significant changes in excitonic binding energies, and a key alteration in orbital character, suggesting an excitonic insulating state in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$ and emphasizing the crucial electronic role of orbitals in the formation of the excitonic insulator state.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal plasmons in one-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directional control of light in miniaturized plasmonic waveguides holds appealing possibilities for emerging nanophotonic technologies, but is hindered by the intrinsic reciprocal optical response of conventional plasmonic materials. While the ability of graphene to sustain large electrical currents shows promise for nonreciprocal plasmonics, studies have been limited to extended samples characterized by linear electrical dispersion. Here, we theoretically explore quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonreciprocal response of mesoscale plasmonic waveguides comprised of drift-biased graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using atomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and self-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate electrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided plasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation by a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon modes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further be leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters. Our results establish graphene nanostructures as a promising atomically thin platform for nonreciprocal nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology of transport in the quantum Hall phases in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that signatures of non-Hermitian topology can be realized in a conventional quantum Hall device connected to multiple current sources. These signatures manifest as robust current-voltage characteristics, dictated by the presence of a nontrivial, non-Hermitian topological invariant of the conductance matrix. Chiral edge states are believed to be responsible for this non-Hermitian response, similar to how they lead to a quantized Hall conductivity in the presence of a single current source. Here, we go beyond this paradigm, showing that multi-terminal conductance matrices can exhibit non-Hermitian topological phase transitions that cannot be traced back to the presence and directionality of a boundary-localized chiral mode. By performing quantum transport simulations in the quantum Hall regime of monolayer graphene, we find that when the chemical potential is swept across the zeroth Landau level, unavoidable device imperfections cause the appearance of an additional non-Hermitian phase of the conductance matrix. This highlights graphene as an ideal platform for the study of non-Hermitian topological phase transitions, and is a first step towards exploring how the geometry of quantum devices can be harnessed to produce robust, topologically-protected transport characteristics.</description>

      <title>Topological Aspects of Dirac Fermions in a Kagom\'e Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac fermion with linear dispersion in the kagom\'e lattice governs the low-energy physics of different valleys at two inequivalent corners of hexagonal Brillouin zone. The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic permutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of Dirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding numbers. For spinless fermions, the many-particle interactions produce intervalley scattering and drive an intervalley coherent state with spontaneous translation symmetry breaking. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the simultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond texture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell of kagom\'e lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass with vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are intimately related to fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is shown to have a distinct $\mathbb{Z}_6$ Berry phase with its sign-change counterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the topological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.</description>

      <title>Multiple topological corner states in the continuum of extended kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome lattice is renowned for its exotic electronic properties, such as flat bands, Dirac points, and Van Hove singularities. These features have provided a fertile ground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we discover that a breathing kagome lattice with long-range hoppings can host multiple zero-energy corner states, which emerge as topologically protected bound states in the continuum (BICs). This result demonstrates that additional hopping control can induce further non-trivial physics of the kagome lattice. Since the zero-energy corner states in the continuum are intertwined with a substantial number of zero-energy bulk states, we also develop a momentum-space topological characterization theory to precisely quantify the number of corner states, revealing a general bulk-corner correspondence. Furthermore, we uncover three distinct types of topological phase transitions (TPTs) for the BICs driven by shifts in the spatial localization of zero-energy bulk and/or edge states. These TPTs are exactly captured by our characterization theory. This work provides deep insights into the topological physics of the kagome lattice and broadens the understanding of its electronic properties</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the vanadium-based 2D kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, a ferromagnetic material with a magnetic moment of 0.86 $\mu_B$ per atom. Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number $|C| = 1$ and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of $\approx$0.40 eV/{\AA}. These findings position 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.</description>

Abstract: Extended Bose-Hubbard models have been employed in the study of cold-atom systems with dipolar interactions. It is shown that, for a certain choice of the coupling parameters, there exists an integrable extended 3-site Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions. A Bethe ansatz procedure is developed to obtain expressions for the energy spectrum and eigenstates.</description>

      <title>About carrier's self-trapping and dynamical Rashba splitting in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$</title>

Abstract: Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) is employed to monitor photoexcited electrons in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$. Photoelectron intensity maps are in good agreement with ab-initio calculations of the band structure. The effective mass is $-0.18 \pm 0.02 m_e$ and $0.12 \pm 0.02 m_e$ for holes and electrons, respectively. In the photoexcited state, spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band cannot be resolved. This sets the upper bound of photoinduced Rashba coupling to $\alpha_C&lt;2.5$ eV\AA. The correlated electron-hole plasma evolves in Wannier excitons with Bohr radius of 2.5 nm, while no sign of self-trapping in small polarons is found within the investigated time window of up to 120 ps following photoexcitation.</description>

      <title>Emergent deterministic entanglement dynamics in monitored infinite-range bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study monitored quantum dynamics of infinite-range interacting bosonic systems in the thermodynamic limit. We show that under semiclassical assumptions, the quantum fluctuations along single monitored trajectories adopt a deterministic limit for both quantum-jump and state-diffusion unravelings, and they can be exactly solved. In particular, the hierarchical structure of the equations of motion explains the coincidence of entanglement criticalities and dissipative phase transitions found in previous finite-size numerical studies. We illustrate the findings on a Bose-Hubbard dimer and a collective spin system.</description>
