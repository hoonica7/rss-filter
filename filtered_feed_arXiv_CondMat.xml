      <title>Superexchanges and Charge Transfer in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Motivated by the recent experimental reports, we study an 11-band Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, by using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches. Our results demonstrate that the major antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ can be significantly weaker than in the bulk at 29.5 Gpa. The out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is significantly reduced by about 27% in film, whereas, the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unchanged. We estimate the antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\parallel}$ and $J_{\perp}$ by using perturbation theory. Regarding charge transfer, we find that biaxial compression in the thin films results in reduced charge-transfer gap compared to the bulk material. We determine the distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) orbitals and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals. A significant particle-hole asymmetry regarding carrier doping is revealed. Our results provide a foundation for subsequent studies of the low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, and ofer key insights into the understanding of physical differences between the film and bulk bilayer nickelate high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Twistraintronics in Square Moire Superlattices of Stacked Graphene Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures with geometries that were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics-induced breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator. By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Short-range Spin Freezing State in the Double Trillium Lattice Spin-Liquid Candidate KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ Revealed via $^{31}$P NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study, combined with thermodynamic measurements and first-principle band-structure calculations, has been conducted to explore the ground state of the $S = 5/2$ double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$. Our experimental results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)]. Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below $T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics. Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Field induced Quantized Longitudinal Conductivity in Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an in plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer magnetic topological insulators, characterized by a quantized longitudinal conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields. This state emerges at a quantum critical point separating quantum anomalous Hall phases tuned by field angle and orientation, directly linking gap-closing behavior to quantized criticality. Temperature and gate dependent transport measurements, supported by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics with universal conductivity, offering both microscopic insight into critical transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing quantum criticality in topological systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Valent Ce Disrupts Magnetic Ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed valency in intermetallics with lanthanide cations is well established as a pathway to unusual charge transport, complex magnetism, and superconductivity. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties of the mixed valent compound CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterize CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ as a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) compound with mixed-valent Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ on a single crystallographic site. $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy indicates that the Fe sublattice is nonmagnetic, in direct contrast with recent reports of this compound. Low-temperature electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements show no evidence of magnetic ordering, and a modest Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma$) of 22.7 mJ/mol$\cdot$K$^2$ make extensive Kondo hybridization unlikely. DC and AC magnetic susceptibility data suggest short-range magnetic order at $\sim$5.2 and 7.6 K with no frequency dependence, ruling out canonical spin-glass behavior in this compound. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility data does not contain any broad features that are typically associated with an intermediate valence state in Ce, suggesting either high-temperature valence fluctuation or a different mechanism of mixed valency. This work demonstrates that mixed-valent Ce inhibits magnetic ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ and provides a broader picture for how to analyze short-range spin interactions in Q1D intermetallics.</description>

      <title>Review of the tight-binding method applicable to the properties of moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring a wide range of ex- otic quantum phenomena. Unlike angstrom-scale materials, the moir\'e length-scale system contains a large number of atoms, and its electronic structure is significantly modulated by the lattice relaxation. These features pose a huge theoretical challenge. Among the available theoretical approaches, tight-binding (TB) methods are widely employed to predict the electronic, transport, and optical properties of systems such as twisted graphene, twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and related moir\'e materials. In this review, we pro- vide a comprehensive overview of atomistic TB Hamiltonians and the numerical techniques commonly used to model graphene-based, TMD-based and hBN-based moir\'e superlattices. We also discuss the connection between atomistic TB descriptions and effective low-energy continuum models. Two examples of different moir\'e materials and geometries are provided to emphasize the advantages of the TB methods. This review is intended to serve as a theoretical and practical guide for those seeking to apply TB methods to the study of various properties of moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Many-body wave function and edge magnetization of an open $p+is$ superconducting chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although BCS wave function for superconductors under periodic boundary conditions are well-established, obtaining an explicit form of the many-body BCS wave function under open boundary condition is usually a nontrivial problem. In this work, we construct the exact BCS ground state wave function of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 superconductor with $p+ is$ pairing symmetry under open boundary conditions for special sets of parameters. The spin magnetization on the edges are calculated explicitly using the obtained wave function. Approximate expression of the wave function is also discussed based on degenerate perturbation theory when the $s$-wave component is much smaller than the $p$-wave one, which provides more intuitive understanding for the system. Our work is useful for obtaining deeper understandings of open $p+ is$ superconducting chains on a wave function level.</description>

      <title>Disorder-broadened topological Hall phase and anomalous Hall scaling in FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that are promising candidates for low-power spintronic memory and logic devices. Realizing skyrmion-based devices requires an understanding of how structural disorder affects their stability and transport properties. This study uses Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$ to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall signal from a narrow window near 200\~K in pristine films down to 4\~K at the highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Terahertz Photoconductivity and Near-Field Imaging of Nanoscale Inhomogeneities in Multilayer Epitaxial Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs) further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime. The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c &gt;$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced electron-electron and electron- phonon scattering and to an interaction of electrons with mid-gap states.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of linear magnetoresistance in Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the quantized energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum, the energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR. Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.</description>

      <title>Coupled dimerized alternating-bond quantum spin chains in the distorted honeycomb-lattice magnet Cu$_5$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound.</description>

      <title>Probing the atomic dynamics of ultrafast melting with femtosecond electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting is an everyday phase transition that is determined by thermodynamic parameters like temperature and pressure. In contrast, ultrafast melting is governed by the microscopic response to a rapid energy input and, thus, can reveal the strength and dynamics of atomic bonds as well as the energy flow rate to the lattice. Accurately describing these processes remains challenging and requires detailed insights into transient states encountered. Here, we present data from femtosecond electron diffraction measurements that capture the structural evolution of copper during the ultrafast solid to liquid phase transformations. At absorbed energy densities 2 to 4 times the melting threshold, melting begins at the surface slightly below the nominal melting point followed by rapid homogeneous melting throughout the volume. Molecular dynamics simulations reproduce these observations and reveal a weak electron lattice energy transfer rate for the given experimental conditions. Both simulations and experiments show no indications of rapid lattice collapse when its temperature surpasses proposed limits of superheating, providing evidence that inherent dynamics limits the speed of disordering in ultrafast melting of metals.</description>

      <title>Compact localized fermions and Ising anyons in a chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms. We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS) emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity in two dimensions: intertwined symmetries and singlet-triplet mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity for the case of two-dimensional square- and triangular-lattice systems. Our approach is based on an effective single particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin Precession and Spin Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of the interplay of charge order and unconventional pairings in the 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide here a study of some competing ordering tendencies exhibited by the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice. To this end, we investigate the interplay between superconductivity, charge-density wave (CDW) and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain. As a result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW. These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the properties of realistic strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>The action of the nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion on the homogeneity in the high concentration domain for itinerant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact results are presented for itinerant systems
  demonstrating that the nearest neighbor Coulomb
  repulsion (V) destroys the homogeneity in the high concentration regime, this
  property being not present in the low concentration domain. Since the effects
  of V often seems contradictory, and the number of phases in which it could
  appear is extremely large, this result underlines that the action of the
  nearest neighbor repulsion is not necessarily routed in the characteristics
  of phases on which it acts, but could be intimately related to V itself.
  The $V &gt; 0$ case usually means non-integrability, hence the deduced exact
  ground states are related to non-integrable systems, the technique being
  based on positive semidefinite operator properties.</description>

      <title>Influence of Bi Alloying on GaAs Valence Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi alloying is predicted to transform GaAs from a semiconductor to a topological insulator or semi-metal. To date, studies of the GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ alloy band structure have been limited, and the origins of Bi-induced enhancement of the spin-orbit splitting energy, $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$, are unresolved. Here, we present high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of droplet-free epitaxial GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ films with $x_{\mathrm{Bi}}$ = 0.06. In addition to quantifying the Bi-induced shifts of the light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands, we probe the origins of the Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$. Using exact-two-component density functional theory calculations, we identify the key role of Bi p-orbitals in the upward shift of the light-hole and heavy-hole bands that results in the Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$.</description>

      <title>Engineering Anderson Localization in Arbitrary Dimensions with Interacting Quasiperiodic Kicked Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of interactions and quasiperiodic driving in the Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons subjected to a sequence of delta kicks. Building on the known mapping between the kicked rotor and the Anderson model, we show that both interparticle interactions and quasiperiodic modulations of the kicking strength can independently and simultaneously generate synthetic dimensions. In the absence of modulation, interactions between two bosons already promote an effective two-dimensional Anderson model. Introducing one or two additional incommensurate frequencies further extends the system to three and four effective dimensions, respectively. Through extensive numerical simulations of the two-body dynamics and finite-time scaling analysis, we observe Anderson localization and the associated critical behavior characteristic of the orthogonal universality class. This combined use of interactions and quasiperiodic driving thus provides a versatile framework for emulating Anderson localization and its transition in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Methods for Quantum Matter: Strongly correlated Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for applying on-shell scattering amplitude methods to emergent relativistic phases of quantum matter. Many strongly correlated systems, from Dirac and Weyl semimetals to topological-insulator surfaces, exhibit low-energy excitations that are effectively massless relativistic spinors. We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Structural modulation, physical properties, and electronic band structure of the kagome metal UCr$_6$Ge$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet, 5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$ members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic ground state across the material family.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum fluctuation effects arising from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle governing angular momentum operators in the full dynamical evolution of disentanglement-entanglement-disentanglement between itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments under the s-d exchange interaction. Beyond the conventional deterministic spin-transfer torque, we identify an intrinsic channel for the transfer of spin quantum fluctuations. By extending the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include both quantum and thermal stochastic fields, we reveal a temperature regime where quantum fluctuations dominate spin dynamics. Furthermore, voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy can exponentially amplify these quantum fluctuation signals, enabling their binary detection via tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions. These results establish a microscopic framework for quantum fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and provide a fundamental route toward spin-based quantum true random number generation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nodal Gap in a Doped Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level, accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2 AFM Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>An improved reliability factor for quantitative low-energy electron diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$ or LEED $I(E)$, the evaluation of diffraction intensities $I$ as a function of the electron energy] is a versatile technique for the study of surface structures. The technique is based on optimizing the agreement between experimental and calculated intensities. Today, the most commonly used measure of agreement is Pendry's $R$ factor $R_\mathrm{P}$. While $R_\mathrm{P}$ has many advantages, it also has severe shortcomings, as it is a noisy target function for optimization and very sensitive to small offsets of the intensity. Furthermore, $R_\mathrm{P} = 0$, which is meant to imply perfect agreement between two $I(E)$ curves can also be achieved by qualitatively very different curves. We present a modified $R$ factor $R_\mathrm{S}$, which can be used as a direct replacement for $R_\mathrm{P}$, but avoids these shortcomings. We also demonstrate that $R_\mathrm{S}$ is as good as $R_\mathrm{P}$ or better in steering the optimization to the correct result in the case of imperfections of the experimental data, while another common $R$ factor, $R_\mathrm{ZJ}$ (suggested by Zanazzi and Jona) is worse in this respect.</description>

Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.</description>

      <title>Impact of the lead factor of neutron irradiation on the magnetic properties of RPV steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials used in nuclear reactors are constantly exposed to the effects of neutron irradiation, which leads to changes in their mechanical properties. In particular, the steels employed in reactor pressure vessels experience a reduction in the ductile-to brittle transition temperature. Given that the pressure vessel is a non-redundant component, understanding this phenomenon is of significant interest. In this work, we focus on studying the effects of accelerated irradiation by maintaining constant neutron fluence while varying neutron flux, which results in different lead factors. This approach enables the extrapolation of accelerated test results to real operational conditions of the reactor pressure vessels. In our study, we analyzed irradiated steels using three magnetic techniques. Each technique responds differently to the microstructural changes induced by irradiation, allowing for a better characterization of its effects on the material. Through DC magnetometry, the analysis of minor loops shows that the remanence, coercivity, and saturation of the steel depend not only on the fluence with which the material was irradiated but also on the irradiation rate, which means, more specifically, on the lead factor. The AC susceptibility technique shows that the response of the irradiated steel to the applied magnetic field increases with fluence but also with the lead factor. For the real part of XAC, there is an increase with the lead factor, while the imaginary component of XAC grows with the size of the nanoprecipitates. Finally, Barkhausen noise measurements show a clear increase in the RMS of the signal with the lead factor.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating functions for quantum metric, Berry curvature, and quantum Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate that the fidelity between two density matrices is a generating function, through which the quantum Fisher information matrix and Christoffel symbol of the first kind in the parameter space can be obtained through derivatives with respect to the parameters. For pure states, the fidelity and phase of the product between two quantum states are shown to be the generating functions of the quantum metric and Berry curvature, respectively. Further limiting to systems described by real wave functions, our formalism recovers the well-known result that the fidelity between two probability mass functions is the generating function of the classical Fisher information matrix, indicating a hierarchy of quantum to information geometry. The Bloch representation of the generating functions is given explicitly for $2\times 2$ density matrices, and the application to canonical ensemble of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model suggests the mitigation of quantum geometry at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Markovian Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian nonreciprocal quantum lattices.</description>

      <title>Mott Gap Softening Coinciding with Spin Correlations Collapse in a-RuCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of many-body electronic correlation entropy from local measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum correlations in many-body systems is instrumental to understanding the nature of emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The correlation entropy serves as a key metric for assessing the complexity of a quantum many-body state in interacting electronic systems. However, its determination requires the measurement of all single-particle correlators across a macroscopic sample, which can be impractical. Machine learning methods have been shown to allow learning the correlation entropy from a reduced set of measurements, yet these methods assume that the targeted system is contained in the set of training Hamiltonians. Here we show that a transfer learning strategy enables correlation entropy learning from a reduced set of measurements in families of Hamiltonians never considered in the training set. We demonstrate this transfer learning methodology in a wide variety of interacting models including local and non-local attractive and repulsive many-body interactions, long-range hopping, doping, magnetic field, and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we show how this transfer learning methodology allows detecting quantum many-body phases never observed during their training set without prior knowledge about them. Our results demonstrate that correlation entropy learning can be potentially performed experimentally without requiring training in the experimentally realized Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic, and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but are symmetric in respect of the product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermagnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of a crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets, there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas, in altermagnets, we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on regular hyperbolic trivalent tilings. Depending on the length $p$ of the elementary polygons, we examine two distinct tri-colorings of the tiling. Using a recent conjecture on the ground-state flux sector, we compute the phase diagram via exact diagonalizations and derive analytical expressions for the effective Hamiltonians in the isolated-dimer limit which are valid for all values of $p$. Our results interpolate between the Euclidean honeycomb lattice and the trivalent Bethe lattice ($p=\infty$) for which we derive the exact solution of the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Controlled Chirality Switching of Weyl Quasiparticles</title>

Abstract: Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal hopping may display the non-Hermitian skin effect, where states under open boundary conditions localize exponentially at one edge of the system. This localization has been linked to spectral winding and topological gain, forming a bulk-boundary correspondence akin to the one relating edge modes to bulk topological invariants in topological insulators and superconductors. In this work, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered Hatano-Nelson models. We relate the localization of states to spectral winding using the Lyapunov exponent and the Thouless formula. We identify two kinds of phase transitions and relate them to transport properties. Our framework is relevant to a broad class of 1D non-Hermitian models, opening new directions for disorder-resilient transport and quantum-enhanced sensing in photonic, optomechanical, and superconducting platforms.</description>

Abstract: Recent researches on tilted Dirac cone materials have unveiled an astonishing property, the metric of the spacetime can be altered in these materials by applying a perpendicular electric field. This phenomenon is observed near the Fermi velocity, which is significantly lower than the speed of light. According to this property, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau action from the microscopic Hamiltonian of the BCS theory for the tilted Dirac cone materials. This derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Landau theory considers structural phase transitions and crystallization as a condensation of several critical density waves whose wave vectors are symmetrically equivalent. Analyzing the simplest nonequilibrium Landau potentials obtained for decagonal and dodecagonal cases, we derive constraints on the phases of the critical waves and deduce two pairs of flat tilings that are the simplest from the viewpoint of our theory. Each pair corresponds to the same irreducible interference pattern: the vertices of the first and second tilings are located at its minima and maxima, respectively. The first decagonal pair consists of the Penrose P1 tiling and the Tie and Navette one. The second pair is represented by dodecagonal tiling of squares, triangles, and shields, and previously unidentified one formed by regular dodecagons and identical deformed pentagons. Surprisingly, the proposed method for finding extrema of interference patterns provides a straightforward way to generate the Penrose tiling P3 and its more complicated analogues with 2n-fold symmetries. Within Landau theory, we discuss the assembly of the square-triangular tiling and its relationship with the dodecagonal tiling that includes shields. Then we develop a nonequilibrium assembly approach that is based on Landau theory and allows us to produce tilings with random phason strain characteristic of quasicrystals. Interestingly, the approach can generate tilings without or with a minimum number of defective tiles. Examples of real systems rationalized within Landau theory are considered as well. Finally, the derivation of other tilings arising from the reducible interference patterns is discussed, and the relative complexity of non-phenomenological interactions required for the assembly of decagonal and dodecagonal structures is analyzed.</description>

Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin Coating: Homogeneous All-Inorganic Perovskite Films via High-Pressure Recrystallization</title>

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinite layer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in correlated topological metals</title>

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations. Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$ compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.</description>

      <title>Topological Modes in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>

Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called $R$-parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Topological order in symmetric blockade structures</title>

Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>
