      <title>Quantum Filtering of Hydrogen Isotopes through Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand in the energy, medical, and industrial sectors, we investigate a hydrogen isotope separation technique that offers both a high separation factor and economic feasibility. Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable and compensated magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\% lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick, maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and +0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry. Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices. Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.</description>

      <title>Superconducting meander-line surface coil for NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study local magnetism in a variety of materials. However, the inherently low sensitivity of conventional inductively detected solid state NMR typically requires a large number of spins, reducing its applicability to two-dimensional (2D) materials and nanoscale thin films. To overcome this experimental challenge, we introduce a novel probe based on a superconducting meander-line surface coil that significantly enhances the NMR sensitivity for thin samples. Using a NbN meander with an optimized geometry, we demonstrate the sensitivity of this technique by detecting the NMR signal of a 150-nm-thick boron film containing only $\sim 2\times10^{16}$ $^{11}$B nuclear spins. Spin-echo measurements and theoretical modeling offer insight into the parameters limiting the coil's performance. This work lays the foundation for developing highly sensitive NMR probes, potentially unlocking new opportunities for studying atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Surface band-selective moir\'e effect induces flat band in mixed-dimensional heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal a curious type of moir\'e effect that selectively modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moir\'e replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moir\'e period in the range of 25 {\AA} to 80 {\AA} by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moir\'e periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moir\'e modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moir\'e effects.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge Excitations of Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field Control of Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids in Ta2Pd3Te5 Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly tunable.Theory and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Twist-tuned exchange and hysteresis in a bilayer van der Waals magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in twisted bilayers enable profound reconstructions of the electronic bandstructure, giving rise to correlated states with remarkable tunability. Extending this paradigm to van der Waals magnets, twisting creates spatially varying interlayer exchange interactions that stabilize emergent spin textures and the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of robust magnetic hysteresis in bilayer CrSBr upon twisting by an angle of ~ 3{\deg}. This is observed as the corresponding hysteretic evolution of the exciton energy, that directly correlates with the bilayer magnetic state, in magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements. A two-sublattice model captures this behavior, attributing it to the twist-induced reduction of interlayer exchange that stabilizes both parallel and antiparallel spin configurations across a broad field range. Comparison with experiment enables quantitative extraction of the effective exchange strength. Remarkably, the system exhibits coherent averaging across the moir\'e supercell, yielding an effective monodomain response characterized by switching into the antiferromagnetic state, rather than forming spin textures or fragmented domains. Spatially resolved measurements further uncover local variations in hysteresis loops, consistent with position-dependent modulation of the average exchange interaction. Our results establish twist engineering as a powerful route to programmable magnetic memories in two-dimensional magnets, harnessing the robustness of antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (&lt;10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</description>

      <title>Strong interlayer coupling and chiral flat-band cascades in twisted bilayer gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization of graphene via the saddle point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Approximating the Quantum Geometric Tensor with Block Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets where transverse Hall voltage emerges without magnetic field, has opened a plethora of promising opportunities in antiferromagnetic devices. The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the N\'eel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed-melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some 2D systems. Here, we imaged silver iodide (AgI) embedded in multilayer graphene using time and temperature resolved in-situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission microscopy (STEM) and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observe the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.</description>

In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states. This Anderson localization transition is the key reason for the suppression of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.</description>

      <title>Proximity Effects Between the Graphene Quasicrystal and Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of three-layer graphene heterostructures in which the layers are twisted by the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^\circ$) or by $\sim$$30^\circ$ to form a graphene quasicrystal. The heterostacks are described using realistic structural relaxations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, and their transport properties are computed for both pristine and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. Owing to the weak interlayer coupling, we resolve the hybridization between magic-angle flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are modified in distinct ways across low- and high-energy windows, revealing a new hybrid electronic regime to explore.</description>

      <title>Variational Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo Built on Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the symmetry breaking of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the N\'{e}el transition, we accurately predict the N\'{e}el temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization and antiferromagnetic susceptibility, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic Transport and First Order Phase Transitions in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Quantum Hall Ferromagnet</title>

Abstract: Large-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) realizes a multicomponent quantum Hall (QH) platform of spin, valley and layer pseudospins with strong Coulomb interaction-driven symmetry broken phases. Here, we investigate the low energy Landau-level spectrum of layer-decoupled TBLG and identify skyrmion-textured charged excitations and a field-induced insulating transition to an intervalley coherent state at zero-filling factor. Symmetric potential difference perpendicular to TBLG demonstrated layer coherent population of ground states with uniform energy barriers, while the charge imbalance in the layers at finite displacement field led to multidomain nucleation and a pronounced hysteresis in the exchange-dominated transport regime suggesting first order phase transitions between different QH ferromagnetic ground states.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films on GaAs (111) substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their unique electronic properties. We report upon the growth and electrical transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films is found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state with high mobility electrons. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. For the thinnest 5 nm film, a hole-like state emerges, presumably as the electron-like state is gapped out. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties, and our ability to tune them.</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</description>

      <title>Phase engineering of 1T$'$ and 1T CrS2 and Cr2S3 by MOCVD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of crystal phases with different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only but not experimentally verified. Here we demonstrate a previously unreported crystal phase of CrS2, namely the distorted octahedral (1T$'$) structure, synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ or 1T phase CrS2. The structure were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), as well as scanning electron diffraction (4D-STEM). 4D-STEM reveals that 1T$'$ crystals grow from an originally nucleated kinetically favoured 1T phase which then transform into the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase. Magneto-optic Kerr imaging reveals that the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature. Our MOCVD growth of complex phases of 2D CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Non-ohmic to ohmic crossover in the breakdown of the quantum Hall states in graphene under broadband excitations</title>

Abstract: Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>

      <title>Recommendations and tools to enable reproducibility in 2D materials research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on 2D materials has achieved significant milestones and fuelled a rapidly growing industrial sector. This progress, however, is accompanied by challenges in reproducibility, arising from the atomic thinness, fragility, and environmental sensitivity of these materials. Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.</description>

      <title>Pauli Stabilizer Models for Gapped Boundaries of Twisted Quantum Doubles and Applications to Composite Dimensional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</description>
