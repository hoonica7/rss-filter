      <title>Comprehensive Structural Characterization of Charged Polymers Involved in Moisture-Driven Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has led to urgent calls for effective carbon capture methods, with direct air capture (DAC) emerging as a promising solution. This study focuses on the structural characterization of commercially available alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AEM) polymers, Fumasep FAA-3 and IRA 900, for use in low-energy, moisture-driven DAC applications. A combination of X-ray diffraction, small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to explore the structural features of these materials. X-ray scattering analysis revealed molecular ordering and large-scale structural organization in both materials, while humidity-induced changes highlighted the impact of moisture on structural properties. AFM surface analysis further indicated the presence of clustering, porosity, and swelling, which were corroborated by FIB-SEM and TEM imaging. These structural insights offer a deeper understanding of the behavior of AEM-DAC materials during CO2 capture and release, emphasizing the role of moisture in these processes. This work lays the foundation for the development of more energy-efficient DAC polymers, paving the way for improved CO2 capture technologies.</description>

      <title>Control of magnetic transition, metal-semiconductor transition, and magnetic anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric monolayer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in two-dimensional materials have greatly expanded the family of ferromagnetic materials. The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI$_3$, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$ with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal-semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te$_3$ atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from $p_z / p_y$ and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field.</description>

      <title>About carrier's self-trapping and dynamical Rashba splitting in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy is employed to monitor photoexcited electrons in the two-dimensional (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$. ARPES intensity maps are in good agreement with ab-initio calculations of the band structure. The effective mass is $-0.18 \pm 0.02 m_e$ and $0.12 \pm 0.02 m_e$ for holes and electrons, respectively. In the photoexcited state, spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band cannot be resolved. This sets the upper bound of photoinduced Rashba coupling to $\alpha_C&lt;2.5$ eV\AA. The correlated electron-hole plasma evolves in Wannier excitons with Bohr radius of 2.5 nm, while no sign of self-trapping in small polarons is found within the investigated time window of up to 120 ps following photoexcitation.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Nonequilibrium Enhancement of Electron-Phonon Interaction in 2H-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.</description>

      <title>Charge-4$e$ Anyon Superconductor from Doping $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid can emerge in the SU($4$) Hubbard model on triangular lattice. A natural question then arises: What is the phase upon doping? In this work, we show the possibility that hole doping can give rise to an anyon superconductor and propose that both spinons and holons form integer quantum Hall states with opposite chiralities. Using topological field theory we demonstrate that the phase is a topological charge-$4e$ superconductor with chiral central charge $c_-=4$. We further identify the deconfined excitations and anyonic excitations bound to the vortex. This unusual superconductor may be realized in moir'e bilayer and detected through quantized thermal Hall effect and spin quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Prediction of Magnetic Proximity Effect in van der Waals Heterostructures: From Atoms to Moir\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework that efficiently predicts large-scale proximity-induced magnetism in van der Waals heterostructures, overcoming the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT). We apply it to graphene/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which exhibits a previously unrecognized dichotomy. Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop a Random Forest model trained on DFT data and employ Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2\,$nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moir\'e textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.</description>

      <title>Bulk photovoltaic effects in the Haldane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12414v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.</description>

      <title>Hubbard energy dependence of electronic structures in rare-earth monoxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize the significant potential of optical materials such as strongly electron-correlated open-shell rare-earth monoxides, understanding the electron-localization Hubbard parameters ($U$) is of central importance. The Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$), even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral response.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst Effect and Its Implications for Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Kagome Metal ScV6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonmagnetic kagome metal ScV6Sn6 displays an unconventional charge order (CO) accompanied by signatures of an anomalous Hall effect, hidden magnetism, and multiple lattice instabilities. In this study, we report the observation of unconventional anomalous thermoelectric properties. Notably, unexpected anomalous transverse Nernst signals reach a peak value of ~4 {\mu}V/K near the TCDW ~92 K in ScV6Sn6, and these signals persist in the charge-ordered state as the temperature decreases to 10 K. Furthermore, both thermopower and thermal conductivity exhibit significant changes under magnetic fields, even in the nonmagnetic ground state. These observations strongly suggest the emergence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in ScV6Sn6, as supported by muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements. While hidden magnetism represents the most plausible origin, alternative mechanisms involving orbital currents and chiral charge order remain possible.</description>

      <title>Chiral Altermagnetic Second-Order Topological Phases and Sign-Reversible Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral materials are rare in nature, yet they play a fundamental role in modern physics due to their unconventional topological properties and transport responses. While chiral charge and structural orders have been extensively studied, chiral magnetic order -- particularly in altermagnets (AMs) -- remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the experimentally well-characterized three-dimensional metal-organic framework K[Co(HCOO)$_3$] represents the first realization of a chiral second-order topological insulator with altermagnetic order. This system hosts $\emph{g}$-wave spin-split bands, controllable second-order topological states, and chirality-locked anomalous transport properties. Its second-order topological phase manifests as alternating spin-up and spin-down hinge modes along the boundaries of hexagonal nanotubes. Remarkably, these spin-polarized hinge states can be switched through lattice chiral inversion. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical effects exhibit reversed signs in left/right-handed enantiomers, substantiating a universal chirality-controlled response across both electronic and optical channels. Our results establish chiral AMs as a promising platform for non-volatile topological spintronics, opening new avenues for manipulating quantum transport via lattice chirality.</description>

      <title>Fermi velocity and magic angle renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Fermi-velocity renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene due to Coulomb exchange interaction within an atomistic tight-binding model. Adopting the Slater-Koster parametrization for the hopping parameters obtained from first principles, our results only depend on the effective dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the Hubbard-interaction $U$. The Fermi velocity of graphene increases twist-angle independent by $~25\%$ for $\epsilon=10$ and $U=4eV$, leading to an increase by more than $100\%$ of the flat bandwidth at twist-angle $\theta=1.4^\circ$. Including also the renormalization of the out-of-plane hopping terms, we further observe a shift of the magic angle from $1.02^\circ$ to $0.96^\circ$. Our results offer a microscopic explanation of the critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the largest $T_c$ is found at $\theta_{max}=1.1^\circ$. For $\theta&gt;\theta_{max}$, $T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For $\theta&lt;\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.</description>

      <title>Observation of Altermagnetic Spin Splitting in an Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a novel magnetic phase combining characteristics of both antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetic ordering. Despite growing theoretical interest in altermagnetic materials, reports of experimentally verified high Neel temperature layered compounds are limited or remain to be firmly established. Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we identify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions of Wigner Crystal in Magnetic Field and Berry Curvature: Multi-Particle Tunneling through Complex Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a weak perpendicular magnetic field $B$ and a Berry curvature $\Omega$ modify the magnetic interactions of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC), using the semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic field is present, various ring-exchange interactions arise from electron tunneling along {\it complex} trajectories, which constitute {\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each ring-exchange constant acquires an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase equal to the magnetic flux enclosed by the real tunneling trajectory of the $B=0$ problem. This effect is directly relevant to two-dimensional electron systems with a small $g$-factor ($g \ll 1$). In the presence of a Berry curvature, multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a (complexified) phase space $({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, the exchange constants acquire the Berry phase enclosed by a {\it purely imaginary} trajectory in a momentum space. Finally, when both $B$ and $\Omega$ are non-zero, in addition to having the AB and Berry phase factors, the magnitude of the exchange constant can also be renormalized by an effective-mass correction. These effects may be relevant for the WC and its proximate phases recently observed in tetra- and penta-layer rhombohedral graphene.</description>

      <title>How reactive is water at the nanoscale and how to control it?</title>

Abstract: Nanoconfined water plays a key role in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and catalysis, yet its reactivity remains a matter of debate. Prior studies have reported both enhanced and suppressed water self-dissociation relative to the bulk, but without a consistent explanation. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials trained at first-principles accuracy, we investigate dissociation behavior in water confined within 2D slit pores and nanodroplets, using graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as model materials. We find that reactivity is extremely sensitive to water density, confinement width, geometry, material flexibility, and surface chemistry. Despite this complexity, we show that chemical potential -- together with interfacial interactions -- governs dissociation trends and explains the variability observed in prior studies. This thermodynamic perspective reconciles previous contradictions and reveals how nanoscale environments can drastically shift water reactivity. Our findings provide molecular-level insight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

Abstract: In the last decades multifaceted manifestations of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation theory have been identified for the many-electron problem. Yet, the investigations have been so far mostly limited to paramagnetic states, where symmetry breaking is not allowed. Here, we extend the analysis to the spontaneously symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the repulsive Hubbard model. To this aim, we calculated two-particle quantities using dynamical mean-field theory for the AF-ordered Hubbard model and studied the possible occurrence of divergences of the irreducible vertex functions in the charge and spin sectors. Our calculations pinpoint the divergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order mitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully prevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical structure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical crossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually increased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the irreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities within the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for two-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented by the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</description>

      <title>A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a well-established framework for understanding transport and optical responses in quantum materials. In this work, I study the photon drag effect in Dirac electrons using the quantum geometric interpretation of non-vertical optical transitions. Due to the particle-hole symmetry inherent in Dirac electrons, the shift photon-drag photocurrent is dominated by dissipationless Fermi surface contributions, connected to the dipole of quantum metric tensor. I find that this dipole is significantly enhanced by a small band gap in massive Dirac electrons and remains robust in the massless limit. I demonstrate the existence of a circular shift photon-drag current in the effective Hamiltonian at the L-point of bismuth, where the bands exhibit trivial topology, highlighting the ubiquity of the circular photon-drag effect in centrosymmetric materials.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest due to their tunable physical properties when stacked into homo- and hetero-structures. Twisting adjacent layers introduces moir\'{e} patterns that strongly influence the material electronic and thermal behavior. In twisted graphene systems, the twist angle critically alters phonon transport, leading to reduced thermal conductivity compared to Bernal-stacked configurations. However, experimental investigations into thermal transport in twisted structures remain limited. Here, we study the local thermal properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We find an increase in thermal resistance of $0.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^6 KW^{-1}$ compared to untwisted bilayers, attributed to changes in both intrinsic thermal conductivity and the tip-sample interface. These results, supported by analytical modeling, provide new insight into thermal transport mechanisms in twisted 2D systems and offer a pathway toward thermal engineering in twistronic devices.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Tunable hyperbolic Landau-level polaritons in charge-neutral graphene nanoribbon metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Field-Tailoring Quantum Materials: Magneto-Synthesis of Metastable Metallic Phases in a Trimer Iridate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.</description>

Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.</description>

Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.</description>
