      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of a one-dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Half-Quantized Hall Metal and Marginal Metal in Disordered Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semimagnetic topological insulator -- a heterostructure combining a topological insulator with a ferromagnet -- exhibits a half-quantized Hall effect, characterized by a quantized Hall conductance of $\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2}}{h}$ (where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant), which reinforces the established understanding of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, its stability in realistic, disordered systems remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the robustness of the half-quantized Hall effect in weakly disordered systems, stemming from a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions and coexisting with weak antilocalization due to the $\pi$ Berry phase that suppresses backscattering. Furthermore, we uncover a marginal metallic phase emerging between weak antilocalization and Anderson insulation -- a transition that defies conventional metal-insulator transitions by lacking an isolated critical point -- where both conductance and normalized localization length exhibit scale invariance, independent of system size. The half-quantized Hall metal and the marginal metallic phase challenge existing localization theories and provide insights into disorder-driven topological phase transitions in magnetic topological insulators, opening avenues for exploring quantum materials and next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity and mass enhancement near CDW critical point based on Bethe-Salpeter equation method: application to cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however, the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad potential for future applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect, which induces a transverse valley current via a second-order thermoelectric response to a longitudinal temperature gradient. The effect arises from the Berry connection polarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both inversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the response tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall conductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly proportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the symmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its nonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a distinct $\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their ratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz number. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and first-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic contributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley pumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed. These findings underscore the significance of band quantum geometry on electron dynamics and establish a theoretical foundation for nonlinear valley caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Optical Switching of Moir\'e Chern Ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical manipulation of quantum matter offers a non-contact, high-precision and fast control. Fractional Chern ferromagnet states in moir\'e superlattices are promising for topological quantum computing, but an effective optical control protocol has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate robust optical switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 bilayers using circularly polarized light. Highly efficient optical manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nanowatts per square micrometer. Utilizing this optically induced transition, we also demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient optical control scheme for moir\'e Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spin Accumulations Drive Magnetization Reversal in Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering and controlling heat and spin transport on the femtosecond time-scale in spintronic devices opens up new ways to manipulate magnetization with unprecedented speed. Yet the underlying reversal mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the challenges of probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that typical magneto-optical experiments can be leveraged to access the time evolution of the spin accumulation generated within a magnetic multilayer following an ultrafast laser excitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the final magnetic state of the free-layer in a spin-valve is mainly dictated by the ultrafast dynamics of the reference-layer magnetization. Our results disentangle magnetization and spin transport dynamics within a multilayer stack and identify demagnetization and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation as the key mechanism for all-optical switching. These findings establish new design principles for ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering.</description>

      <title>MnBr$_2$ on the graphene on Ir(110) substrate: growth, structure, and super-moir\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer MnBr$_2$ is grown on graphene (Gr) supported by Ir(110) and investigated using low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and spectroscopy. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The growth morphology strongly depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the underlying surface diffusion processes. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moir\'e pattern --a moir\'e of moir\'es. Due to the involvement of lattices of differing symmetries and the partial electronic transparency of Gr, a "virtual" moir\'e formed by MnBr$_2$ and Ir(110) contributes to the super-moir\'e formation. Ab initio calculations play a crucial role in understanding the complexity of super-moir\'e. Moreover, the pronounced variation in the apparent height with tunneling conditions for the magnetic insulator is explained based on the measured electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale mechanics and ultralow Friction of natural 2D silicates: Biotite and Rhodonite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) silicates have emerged as a promising class of ultrathin materials, expanding the landscape of 2D systems beyond conventional van der Waals crystals. Their unique crystal chemistries and structural anisotropies make them attractive for applications ranging from sensors and flexoelectric devices to drug delivery and catalysis. To unlock their full potential, it is critical to understand their thickness-dependent mechanical properties within the family of 2D silicates. In this study, we investigate the nanomechanical and frictional behaviors of two structurally distinct natural silicates: layered Biotite and chain-structured Rhodonite. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we found that Rhodonite exhibits nearly ten times higher adhesion force and modulus response compared to Biotite. Despite this, Biotite demonstrates superior frictional performance, with ultrathin (5 nm) flakes showing a remarkably low coefficient of friction ($\sim 0.6 \times 10^{-3}$) versus Rhodonite ($\sim 3.6 \times 10^{-3}$). To further elucidate interlayer adhesion, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Hubbard correction were employed. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and selection of 2D silicates for advanced mechanical and tribological applications.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Doping Effects on Altermagnetism in MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Governed by specific symmetries, altermagnetism is an emerging field in condensed matter physics, characterized by unique spin-splitting of the bands in the momentum space co-existing with the compensated magnetization as in antiferromagnets. As crystals can have tailored and unintended defects, it is important to gain insights on how altermagnets are affected by the defects-driven symmetry-breaking which, in turn, can build promising perspectives on potential applications. In this study, considering the widely investigated MnTe as a prototype altermagnet, defects are introduced through substitutional doping to create a large configuration space of spin space groups. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials, augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping driven tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this developing field.</description>

      <title>Anomalous tensorial properties of anisotropic 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd transport phenomena -- defined as a flux response orthogonal to an applied gradient -- have been recently observed in isotropic systems, with a multitude of proposed models and experiments to study these effects. Odd transport manifests in tensors that describe linear relations between fluxes and gradients that drive them, particularly when parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we identify such odd properties to be a subset of a broader class of major-symmetry-breaking behaviors, which we term ``anomalous." We develop a classification of anomalous properties described by $2^\mathrm{nd}$ and $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in anisotropic 2D materials that maintain discrete rotational and reflection symmetries, characterized by the 17 wallpaper groups. To this end, we present representation theorems for these tensors, identifying which components are constrained for specific spatial symmetries and thereby allowing materials to be grouped into classes that exhibit anomalous responses or not. We focus our discussion on $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order tensors in the context of electrical resistivity and on $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in the context of viscosity and elasticity. These findings are broadly applicable to the study of novel emergent material properties. To illustrate this, we discuss implications of our findings for two very different 2D materials that have recently garnered attention in condensed matter physics: knitted fabrics and twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</description>

      <title>Pressure suppresses the density wave order in kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dancing tins pair up,
  But compressing the framework
  Thwarts the displacements.
  The density waves that develop in kagome metals ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ and LuNb$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ at low temperature appear to arise from under-filled atomic columns within a V-Sn or Nb-Sn scaffolding. Compressing this network with applied pressure in ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ suppressed the structural transition temperature by constraining atomic rattling and inhibiting the shifts that define the structural modulation. We predicted that the density wave transition in LuNb$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ at 68 K would be suppressed by pressure as well. In this brief study, we examine the pressure dependence of the density wave transition by measuring resistance vs temperature up to 2.26 GPa. We found the transition temperature is smoothly depressed and disappears around 1.9 GPa. This result not only addresses our prediction, but strengthens the rattling chains origin of structural instabilities in the HfFe$_{6}$Ge$_{6}$-type kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Influence of excitation energy on microscopic quantum pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient charge separation in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is crucial for optimizing light-harvesting and detection applications. However, precise control over the microscopic pathways governing ultrafast charge transfer remains an open challenge. These pathways are intrinsically linked to charge transfer states with strongly delocalized wave functions that appear at various momenta in the Brillouin zone. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to investigate the possibility of steering carriers through specific charge transfer states in a prototypical WS2-graphene heterostructure. By selectively exciting electron-hole pairs at the K-point and close to the Q-point of WS2 with different pump photon energies, we find that charge separation is faster at higher excitation energies. We attribute this to distinct tunneling mechanisms dictated by the momentum where the initial excitation takes place. Our findings reveal that the microscopic pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in vdW heterostructures are highly sensitive to the excitation energy, an aspect that should be carefully considered when optimizing the performance of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Colloidal nanoparticles in cholesteric liquid crystals: Bulk properties, biaxiality and untwisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in cholesteric liquid crystal samples in the dilute limit, in a Landau-de Gennes theoretical framework. The effects of the suspended NPs are captured by a homogenized energy, as outlined in [7]. For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau-de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges, and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles, in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric quantities. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</description>

      <title>Atomically clean free-standing two-dimensional materials through heating in ultra-high vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface contamination not only influences but in some cases even dominates the measured properties of two-dimensional materials. Although different cleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used spectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved cleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the true cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In this work, freestanding monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are annealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating chamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum transfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a function of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of airborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 {\deg}C already reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 {\deg}C or higher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically clean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by defects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample transfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used for further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating interaction with the material rather than contamination.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and planar Hall effect in HfTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>
