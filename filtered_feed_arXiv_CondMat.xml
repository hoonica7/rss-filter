      <title>Nonanalytic Fermi-liquid correction to the specific heat of RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic nature of the altermagnet candidate RuO$_2$ remains under debate. It has been recently shown from quantum oscillations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that the high-quality RuO$_2$ bulk single crystal is a paramagnetic metal. However, the low-temperature specific heat exhibits a clear deviation from the conventional $C(T)$=$\gamma T$ + $\beta T^3$ dependence; it is well described with nonanalytic Fermi-liquid correction for a clean paramagnetic metal: $C(T)$ = $\gamma T$ + $\beta T^3$ + $\delta T^3 \textrm{ln}(T/T^*)$. Correspondingly, the magnetic susceptibility is well fitted with the inclusion of $T^2\textrm{ln}T$ term as well as $H^2\mathrm{ln}H$ term. In contrast to the spin fluctuation mechanism applicable to some heavy-electron compounds with positive $\delta$, RuO$_2$ shows negative $\delta$ suggesting a different origin. The observation of such nonanalytic Fermi liquid corrections is attributable to the availability of an ultra-clean sample. The electronic specific heat, the magnetic susceptibility, and the $T^2$ coefficient in resistivity point to a weakly-correlated 3D Fermi-liquid state with a modest electron correlation, as supported by the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios.</description>

      <title>Strain Response as a Probe of Spinons in Quantum Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ intercalated into graphite: a new three-dimensional platform for exotic quantum phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.</description>

      <title>Proof that Momentum Mixing Hatsugai Kohmoto equals the Twisted Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove formally that the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto model (MMHK) is the Hubbard model with a twist. With this result in tow, we rely on the proof of Watanabe's that two models which differ by a twist must have the same bulk physics. Consequently, we have proven that MMHK=Hubbard in the charge sector.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Theory of the Ultrafast Optical Response of 2D-Quantum-Confined Semiconductors at Elevated Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach to the magneto-fluorescence of triplet excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluorescence of triplet excitons and color-centers is strongly dependent on magnetic field that mixes the zero field spin eigenstates that determine the radiative recombination rates back into the singlet ground state through spin-orbit coupling. For films of molecules, and polycristaline color-centers samples an average over molecular orientations has to be performed to model the magneto-fluorescence lineshapes. This limits our analytical understanding of the lineshapes and complicates the analysis of the fluorescence dependence on magnetic field. Here, we present a framework that allows to average over triplet molecular orientations analytically. Our approach achieves provides very accurate numerical routines computing precisely the averages matrix elements that appear in magneto-fluorescence and semi-analytical approximations that can be used to model experimental traces.</description>

      <title>Curvature Potential Formulation for Thin Elastic Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin elastic sheets appear in systems ranging from graphene to biological membranes, where phenomena such as wrinkling, folding, and thermal fluctuations originate from geometric nonlinearities. These effects are treated within weakly nonlinear theories, such as the Foppl-von Karman equations, which require small slopes and fail when deflections become large even if strains remain small. We introduce a methodological progress via a geometric reformulation of thin-sheet elasticity based on a stress potential and a curvature potential. This formulation preserves the structure of the classical equations while extending their validity to nonlinear, multivalued configurations, and geometrically frustrated states. The framework provides a unified description of thin-sheet mechanics in regimes inaccessible to existing theories and opens new possibilities for the study of elastic membranes and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Protected Bipolar Skin Effect and its Topological Breakdown in Disordered Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and disorder remains a central puzzle in open quantum systems. While the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is known to be robust against weak perturbations, its fate under strong disorder, particularly in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), is not fully understood. Here, we uncover a Z_2 topological bipolar skin effect in a non-Hermitian Rashba chain, where spin-up and spin-down eigenstates localize at opposite boundaries. By strictly computing the Lyapunov exponents and introducing a biorthogonal spin-separation index, we map the global phase diagram and reveal a hierarchical breakdown of topology. We demonstrate that the Z_2 skin effect is protected against moderate disorder but collapses into a trivial skin phase before the ultimate onset of Anderson localization. Our results establish a distinct regime of disorder-robust topological non-reciprocity, distinguishable from both the trivial bulk limit and the Anderson localized phase.</description>

      <title>A Space-Charge-Limited van der Waals Spin Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating semiconducting and magnetic materials could combine transistor-like operation with nonvolatility and enable architectures such as logic-in-memory. Here, we employ correlated electrical transport and scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to elucidate a spin transistor concept that amalgamates both vertical and lateral transport in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor, distinct from purely vertical tunneling devices. Our device, based on a monolayer-bilayer junction in CrSBr, displays giant, gate-tunable magnetoresistance driven by the dual action of electrostatic doping on space-charge-limited lateral conduction and interlayer exchange coupling. Moreover, we visualize a field-trainable, layer-sharing effect that selects between coherent or domain-wall reversal at the spin-flip transition, enabling multilevel, memristive conductance states. These findings open opportunities for 2D magnetic semiconductors to address limitations in contemporary computing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in an amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stemming from antiferromagnetic coupling, exchange bias allows inverted hysteresis in a magnetic system. Such room temperature magnetic reversal has yet to be observed in an amorphous antiferromagnet. Furthermore, the impact of this exchange bias effect on its magnetoelectric transport behavior remains a mystery. Here we discovered a zero-field magnetization switching effect in an exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted magnetic hysteresis. This zero-field magnetic reversal was further evidenced by its inverted large anomalous Hall effect. Notably, this collective spin flipping at zero field can occur at room temperature or above room temperature, which may be associated with quantum interference effect due to thermal fluctuation enhanced disorder. Our experimental results offer a way to design room-temperature exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnets with zero-field multi magnetic-states and large anomalous Hall effect, holding potential for low-power and high-density memory applications.</description>

      <title>Generative Refinement:A New Paradigm for Determining Single Crystal Structures Directly from HKL Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) is the gold standard technique to characterize crystal structures in solid state. Despite significant advances in automation for structure solution, the refinement stage still depends heavily on expert intervention and subjective judgment, limiting accessibility and scalability. Herein, we introduce RefrActor, an end-to-end deep learning framework that enables crystal structure determination directly from HKL data. By coupling a physics-informed reciprocal-space encoder (ReciEncoder) with a symmetry-aware diffusion-based generator (StruDiffuser), RefrActor produces fully refined atomic models without requiring initial structural guesses or manual input. Comprehensive evaluations on the GenRef-10k benchmark demonstrates that RefrActor achieves low R1-factors across diverse systems, including low-symmetry, light-atom, and heavy-atom crystals. Case studies further confirm that RefrActor can correctly resolve hydrogen positions, elemental assignments, and moderate disorder. This work establishes a new data-driven paradigm for autonomous crystallographic analysis, offering a foundation for fully automated, high-throughput crystal structure determination.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Modulated Electron Lattice and d-Wave Superconductivity in Cuprates: A Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Magneto-Optical Effects in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal altermagnets are a class of collinear, crystal-symmetry-enforced fully compensated magnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands, in which contributions from Berry curvature to magneto-optical effects (MOEs) are strictly forbidden by an effective time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that, in such systems, MOEs are exclusively induced by the quantum metric and, in realistic altermagnets, are typically dominated by it. We refer to Berry-curvature-induced MOEs as conventional MOEs and to quantum-metric-dominated MOEs as unconventional MOEs. We derive general formulas that incorporate both Berry curvature and quantum metric for unconventional MOEs in altermagnets, enabling a quantitative evaluation of their respective contributions. Through symmetry analysis, we prove that ideal altermagnets are constrained to exhibit only unconventional MOEs. Using the three-dimensional canonical altermagnet MnTe and the emerging two-dimensional bilayer twisted altermagnet CrSBr as illustrative examples, we demonstrate that unconventional MOEs are prevalent in altermagnets. Our results establish altermagnets as a natural platform for quantum-metric-driven optical phenomena, substantially broadening the scope of MOEs and providing concrete predictions that can be tested in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Current switching behaviour mediated via hinge modes in higher order topological phase using altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework to engineer hybrid-order and higher-order topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulators by coupling to $d$-wave altermagnets (AMs). Presence of only $d_{x^2-y^2}$-type AM drives the system into a hybrid-order topological phase where both first-order and second-order topological phases coexist. This phase is characterized by spectral analysis, low-energy surface theory, dipolar and quadrupolar winding numbers, and it's signature is further confirmed by two-terminal differential conductance calculations. Incorporation of the $d_{x^2-z^2}$-type AM drives the system into two second-order topological insulator phases hosting distinct type of hinge modes. They are also topologically characterized by spectral analysis, topological invariants, low-energy surface thoery, and transport calculations. Importantly, the localization and direction of propagation of these one-dimensional hinge modes are controllable by tuning the relative strengths of the alermagnetic exchange orders. We utilize this feature to propose a tunable current-switching behaviour mediated via the hinge modes. Our results establish AMs based hybrid structure as a versatile platform for controllable higher-order topology and hinge-mediated device applications.</description>

From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$\theta_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $\theta_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert \theta_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Critical Fluctuations: Potential Driver of Strange Metallicity and Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in YbRh2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of combined thermal and electrical transport measurements through the magnetic field-induced quantum critical point in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh2Si2 are revisited to explore the relationship between the strange-metal behavior, observed in both the electrical and electronic thermal resistivity, and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the zero-temperature limit. A new type of inelastic scattering center for the charge and heat carriers has been detected and ascribed to the small-to-large Fermi-surface fluctuations. These are operating in the vicinity of and at the Kondo-destroying quantum critical point as fermionic quantum critical fluctuations and are considered the primary driver of the strange-metal behavior and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.</description>

      <title>From fractional Chern insulators to topological electronic crystals in moir\'e MoTe2: quantum geometry tuning via remote layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions,encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, is believed to be a decisive ingredient in stabilizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect(i.e., fractional Chern insulator, FCI, at zero magnetic field), against competing symmetry-breaking phases.A direct experimental demonstration of quantum geometry-driven switching between distinct correlated topological phases, however, has been lacking. Here, we report experimental evidence of such a switch in a high-quality 3.7 twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) device consisting of both A-A bilayer and A-AB trilayer regions. While composite Fermi liquid CFL/FQAH phases are established in A-A tMoTe2,the A-AB region-effectively an A-A moire bilayer proximitized by a remote B layer-develops a series of topological electronic crystal (TEC, also referred to as generalized QAH crystal, QAHC) states with integer quantized Hall conductance at commensurate fractional fillings v=1/2, 2/3, and an incommensurate filling factor v=0.53.The electrostatic phase diagram is mapped out by combined transport and optical measurements, showing that these TEC states emerge within the first moir'e valence band prior to any charge transfer to the B layer. Exact diagonalization (ED) incorporating the remote-layer-induced intralayer potential demonstrates a transition from a CFL-like manifold in the A-A limit to a Chern number C=1 ground-state consistent with a TEC at v=1/2 , accompanied by the further breakdown of ideal band geometry. Our results provide experimental evidence of quantum geometry-tuned competition between FQAH/CFL and TEC phases in a moir\'e Chern band and pave the way for further exploring correlation-driven topological phenomena by tuning quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold fermions in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattices are a promising platform for simulating the behavior of complex materials and implementing quantum gates. We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant. We obtain high-fidelity gates based on a one-dimensional confinement simulation. Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately.</description>

      <title>Tuning spin currents in collinear antiferromagnets and altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin current generation through non-relativistic spin splittings, found in uncompensated magnets and d-wave altermagnets, is desirable for low-power spintronics. Such spin currents, however, are symmetry forbidden in conventional collinear antiferromagnets and higher-order altermagnets. Using spin point group analysis, we demonstrate that finite spin currents can be induced in these materials via magnetoelectric, piezomagnetic, and piezomagnetoelectric-like couplings. We utilize electric fields, strain, and their combinations to drive symmetry-lowering phase transitions into uncompensated magnetic or d-wave altermagnetic states, thereby enabling finite spin conductivity in a broader class of magnetic materials. We further substantiate this framework using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport calculations on representative magnetic materials - KV2Se2O, RuF4 , Cr2O3 , FeS2 , and MnPSe3 - spanning these different cases. The charge-to-spin conversion ratio reaches up to almost 100% via uncompensated magnetism and about 40% via d-wave altermagnetism under realistic conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach for efficient spin current generation.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic Functional Properties in Collinear Antiferromagnets Based on Multipole Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Tc in Oxide Superconductors: Double-Bridge Mechanism of High-Tc Superconductivity and Bose-Einstein Condensation of Cooper Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cuprate Hg0.8Tl0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8.33 exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc of 138K. Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*&gt;Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a&lt;0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.
  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.
  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Terahertz light driven coherent excitation of a zone-folded Raman-active phonon mode in the Spin-Ladder System $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium lattice dynamics in the spin-ladder system $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$ using intense terahertz (THz) pump and near-infrared (NIR) probe spectroscopy. When quasi-single-cycle THz pulses interact with $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$ in its low-temperature, dimerized charge-ordered phase, they induce coherent oscillations in the time domain at the zone-folded Raman-active phonon frequency of 1.85 THz. By combining pump-probe measurements with lattice dynamics modeling based on equation-of-motion approach, we propose that these oscillations arise from a nonlinear coupling between Raman-active and infrared (IR)-active phonon modes, with the latter being resonantly excited by the THz pulses. In contrast, excitation with NIR femtosecond laser pulses does not produce measurable vibrational dynamics, highlighting the unique potential of THz-driven, nonlinear light-matter interactions for the coherent and selective control of structural dynamics in quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of two-dimensional (2D) materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has shown excellent performance and rich physics. As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of superconductivity above 200 K in CaH6 revolutionized research on hydrogen-rich superconductors, and subsequent experiments have verified this prediction, while unidentified peaks in XRD and the decrease in superconducting temperature upon decompression indicate that unresolved issues remain. In this work, we combine theory and experiment to construct an accurate temperature-pressure phase diagram of the Ca-H system and identify the stability ranges of the candidate superconducting phases by considering anharmonic effects. Our results demonstrate that type-I clathrate Ca8H46-delta structures become thermodynamically stable at 0 K when anharmonic effects are considered. Notably, we found that the previously predicted CaH6 phase achieves stability above 500 K, underscoring the significant role of temperature and anharmonic effects in stabilizing this intriguing high-pressure phase. Experimentally, we have successfully synthesized Ca8H46-delta phases at low temperatures, thereby validating our theoretical predictions. Our findings offer insights into the structure and superconducting mechanisms of hydrides.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport and Carrier Dynamics in Quasi-One-Dimensional Antiferromagnet KMn$_6$Bi$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional materials $A$Mn$_6$Bi$_5$ ($A$ = Na, K, Rb, Cs) exhibit unique electronic behaviors such as antiferromagnetism, charge density waves, and pressure-induced superconductivity. Thus, they serve as a suitable model system to investigate emergent quantum phenomena produced by the interactions among spin, charge, and lattice. Here we report the magnetotransport properties of KMn$_6$Bi$_5$, revealing a cascade of temperature-dependent carrier dynamics. Below 5 K, the system, despite its anisotropic electronic structure, could be effectively described by an isotropic two-band model and exhibits a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance ($\propto B^{1.8}$). Upon warming, a crossover to a single-band regime occurs around 20 K, driven by the suppression of a hole pocket. Electron density recovers as antiferromagnetic gap openings gradually close from 25 to 70 K which is just below the N$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$el temperature. Within this temperature range, field-quenched spin fluctuations suppress magnetoresistance. Furthermore, we attribute the low-temperature resistivity upturn to the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. These findings provide crucial insights into the interplay of dimensionality, magnetism, and electron correlations in quasi-one-dimensional magnetic semimetals.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Control of Orbital Occupancy and Spin State in LaCoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal oxides exhibit a wide range of tunable electronic properties arising from the complex interplay of charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom, governed by their $d$ orbital configurations, making them particularly interesting for oxide electronics and (electro)catalysis. Perovskite oxide heterointerfaces offer a promising route to engineer these orbital states. In this work, we tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy in LaCoO$_3$ from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state through interfacial engineering with LaTiO$_3$, LaMnO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$ and LaNiO$_3$. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with charge transfer multiplet calculations, we identify differences in the Co valence and spin state for the series of oxide heterostructures. LaTiO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$ interfaces result in interfacial charge transfer towards LaCoO$_3$, resulting in a partial $d^7$ orbital occupancy, while a LaNiO$_3$ interface results in a partial Co $d^5$ occupancy. Strikingly, a LaAlO$_3$ spacer layer between LaNiO$_3$ and LaCoO$_3$ results in a Co $d^6$ low spin state. These results indicate that the Co spin state, like the valence state, is governed by the interfacial environment. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging reveals a clear connection between strain and spin configuration, emphasizing the importance of structural control at oxide interfaces. Overall, this work demonstrates that interfacial engineering simultaneously governs orbital occupancy and spin state in correlated oxides, advancing spin-engineering strategies in correlated oxides and offering new insights for the rational design of functional oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is emerging as a promising route toward the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. Here, we develop an analytical model for the proximity effect induced by an ordinary s-wave superconductor (SC) placed on top of a MTI thin film with finite thickness. Using a perturbative approach with respect to the electron tunneling between MTI and SC, we derive the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function and evaluate the position-dependent induced pairing as a function of all the system parameters. This framework allows us to resolve the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of the induced superconducting order parameter. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the decay length of the pairing amplitude at the $k_x=k_y=0$ point, and show that increasing magnetization enhances the spin-polarized triplet components and the p-wave contributions of the anomalous Green's function. These findings highlight the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in MTI films, providing analytical insight into the emergence of unconventional pairing symmetries relevant for the realization of Majorana modes in finite geometries.</description>

      <title>Highly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics and Spectral Weight Redistribution in the Trilayer Nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis charge dynamics of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using optical spectroscopy. While a pronounced Drude profile, i.e. metallic response, is observed in the $ab$-plane optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$, the $c$-axis optical spectra $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ exhibit semiconducting behavior. The zero-frequency extrapolation of the optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}(\omega \rightarrow 0) \equiv 1/\rho_{\text{dc}}$ gives a resistivity anisotropy of $\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} \simeq 366$ at 300 K for La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which is much larger than the values in iron-based superconductors but comparable to those in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. The interband response is also highly anisotropic, showing salient orbital selectivity for light polarized in the $ab$ plane and along the $c$ axis. The interband-transition peaks in both $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$ and $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ are located at lower energies compared to density-functional-theory predictions, signifying considerable electronic correlations. By investigating the spectral weight transfer, we find that in the pristine phase, Coulomb correlations have a marked impact on the charge dynamics of \LNO, whereas in the density-wave state, a gap opens with the Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ orbital being involved.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric planar magnetotransport: a probe for magnetic geometry in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport phenomena provide a direct probe of band quantum geometry in noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials, such as the nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole. In altermagnets, a recently discovered class of even-parity collinear magnets with $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, conventional second-order responses are prohibited by an emergent $C_{2z}$ symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders. We show that the field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including the planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses. Our work establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, providing a general framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced modulation of conductance in graphene with magnetic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.</description>

      <title>Resolving Structural Transitions in Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a temperature-composition phase diagram for the chemically disordered and CeO2-LA2O3 high entropy oxides (HEOs), where LA denotes equimolar Y, La, Sm, and Pr, delineating stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and intermediate vacancy-ordered fluorite phases. The diagram is constructed from a characterization package applied to bulk ceramics including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, to quantify crystal structure at multiple length-scales, local coordination environments, and electronic structures across the formulation space. This comprehensive measurement suite is critical to identify boundaries between the closely related phases. For example, Raman scattering reveals local structural and defect environments unique to bixbyite local order that persist to ~50% Ce under equilibrium synthesis conditions but are invisible to XRD and TEM. We also report a companion thin film study to demonstrate that quenched kinetic energy from a physical deposition process can metastabilize the high symmetry, and thus high entropy, fluorite phase with only 20% Ce. This is noteworthy because electroneutrality constraints demand an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice; we estimate 16.7%, approaching that of delta-Bi2O3. Together, our equilibrium ceramics and far-from-equilibrium thin films show that when synthesis is coupled with rigorously chosen, multi-length-scale characterization, now one can identify the phase stability thermodynamic drivers and simultaneously derive practical guidelines for experimentally realizing targeted phases and structures - and thereby deliberately engineer properties in CeO2-LA2O3 HEOs, whose broad defect chemistries demand such an approach.</description>

      <title>Visualization of vortex sheets and half quantum vortices in the chiral odd-parity superconductor UPt$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity is characterized by vanishing electrical resistance and magnetic flux expulsion. For conventional type II superconductors, the magnetic flux expulsion is incomplete in an applied magnetic field above a critical value and magnetic flux penetrates the bulk of the superconductor in discrete quantized magnetic flux tubes (vortices), each carrying a single quantum of flux (h/2e). Investigating the unconventional superconductor UPt$_{3}$ with a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope, we observed mobile half-quantum vortices together with one quantum vortices. Cooling the material under a higher magnetic field revealed the presence of lines of magnetic contrast resembling domain walls. These observations agree with theoretical predictions for chiral superconductivity with a two dimensional complex order-parameter with sheets of half-quantum vortices separating domains of opposite order-parameter chirality.</description>

      <title>A microscopic theory of Anderson localization of electrons in random lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of Anderson localization, characterized by vanishing diffusion due to strong randomness, has been demonstrated in numerous ways. A systematic approach based on the Anderson quantum model of the Fermi gas in random lattices that can describe both diffusive and localized regimes has not yet been fully established. We build upon a recent publication \cite{Janis:2025ab} and present a microscopic theory of disordered electrons covering both the metallic phase with extended Bloch waves and the localized phase where the propagating particle forms a quantum bound state with the hole left behind at the origin. The general theory provides a framework for constructing controlled approximations to one-particle and two-particle Green functions that satisfy the necessary conservation laws and causality requirements in the whole range of disorder strength. It is used explicitly to derive a local, mean-field-like approximation for the two-particle irreducible vertices, enabling quantitative analysis of the solution's properties in both metallic and localized phases, including critical behavior at the Anderson localization transition.</description>

      <title>Non-radiative energy transfer between boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride and other 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron vacancies ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for two-dimensional quantum sensors capable of operating at atomic-scale proximity. However, the mechanisms responsible for photoluminescence quenching in thin hBN sensing layers when placed in contact with absorptive materials remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Phonon Dynamics and Directional Transport in Actinide van der Waals Semiconductor USe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction-dependent charge transport and optical responses are characteristic of van der Waals (vdW) materials with strong in-plane anisotropy. While transition-metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs) exemplify this behavior, heavier analogs remain largely unexplored. In this study we examine USe$_3$ as an anisotropic vdW material and a heavier analog of the well-studied TMTCs. We reveal strong in-plane anisotropy using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, investigate strain-induced shifts of phonon modes, and quantify direction-dependent charge-carrier mobility through transport measurements on field-effect devices. First-principles calculations based on density-functional theory corroborate our findings, providing a theoretical basis for our experimental observations. Casting USe$_3$ as an actinide analog of a TMTC establishes a platform for exploring low-dimensional semiconductors that combine strong in-plane anisotropy with f-electron physics.</description>

      <title>The Loss Landscape of Powder X-Ray Diffraction-Based Structure Optimization Is Too Rough for Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving crystal structures from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a central challenge in materials characterization. In this work, we study the powder XRD-to-structure mapping using gradient descent optimization, with the goal of recovering the correct structure from moderately distorted initial states based solely on XRD similarity. We show that commonly used XRD similarity metrics result in a highly non-convex landscape, complicating direct optimization. Constraining the optimization to the ground-truth crystal family significantly improves recovery, yielding higher match rates and increased mutual information and correlation scores between structural similarity and XRD similarity. Nevertheless, the landscape may remain non-convex along certain symmetry axes. These findings suggest that symmetry-aware inductive biases could play a meaningful role in helping learning models navigate the inverse mapping from diffraction to structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent capability to use THz pulses to control the nuclear quantum degrees of freedom in crystals has opened promising avenues for the advanced manipulation of material properties. While numerical approaches exist for studying the time evolution of the quantum nuclear density matrix, an interpretable analytical framework to explicitly analyze the influence of quantum fluctuations on nuclear dynamics remains lacking. In this work, we present an analytical quantum theory of nonlinear phononics. This framework is a basis for deriving models of realistic materials, allowing for exact solutions of the nuclear time evolution with full consideration of quantum fluctuations. This is accomplished by treating for all possible third- and fourth-order phonon couplings and expressing forces as analytic functions of such fluctuations. We provide an analytic proof that, in general, a strong pulse displacing a phonon mode from equilibrium induces the quenching, or squeezing, of its quantum lattice fluctuations. This finding, which establishes a systematization of the mechanism observed in Ref. 1, introduces a new paradigm in nonlinear phononics, harnessing this cooling effect to drive symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-component fractional quantum Hall (2C-FQH) states in electron bilayers have been known for decades, yet their experimental realization remained limited to low-order fractions. Here we report on several families of high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge when an in-plane magnetic field drives a controlled monolayer-to-bilayer transition in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well. These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $\nu = 1$, from both $\nu = 2/3$ and $\nu = 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences. Our findings substantially expand the known landscape of 2C-FQH states, highlighting the unexpected richness of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and opening new routes for probing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial exchange coupling between antiferromagnets (AFMs) and ferromagnets (FMs) crucially makes it possible to shift the FM hysteresis, known as exchange bias, and to switch AFM states. Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM-FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS$_4$, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM-FM technologies.</description>

      <title>Sign-Resolved Statistics and the Origin of Bias in Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations are a powerful tool for exploring strongly correlated many-body phenomena. Yet, their reach is limited by the fermion sign problem, which causes configuration weights to become negative, compromising statistical sampling. In auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the doped Hubbard model, neglecting the sign ${\cal S}$ of the weight leads to qualitatively wrong results -- most notably, an apparent suppression rather than enhancement of $d$-wave pairing at low temperature. Here we approach the problem from a different perspective: instead of identifying negative-weight paths, we examine the statistics of measured observables in a sign-resolved manner. By analyzing histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with ${\cal S}=\pm1$, we derive an exact relation linking the bias from ignoring the sign to the difference between sign-resolved means, $\Delta\mu$, and the average sign, $\langle {\cal S}\rangle$. Our framework provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo and clarifies why observables such as the $d$-wave susceptibility are especially sensitive to the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Transport evidence of surface states in magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators can host chiral 1D edge channels at zero magnetic field, when a magnetic gap opens at the Dirac point in the band structure of 2D topological surface states, lead- ing to the quantum anomalous Hall effect in ultra-thin nanostructures. For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.</description>

      <title>A high-order regularized delta-Chebyshev method for computing spectral densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method for computing spectral densities, and apply it to the evaluation of the local density of states (LDOS) of sparse Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding models. The approach, which we call the high-order delta-Chebyshev method, can be viewed as a variant of the popular regularized Chebyshev kernel polynomial method (KPM), but it uses a high-order accurate approximation of the $\delta$-function to achieve rapid convergence to the thermodynamic limit for smooth spectral densities. The costly computational steps are identical to those for KPM, with high-order accuracy achieved by an inexpensive post-processing procedure. We apply the algorithm to tight-binding models of graphene and twisted bilayer graphene, demonstrating high-order convergence to the LDOS at non-singular points.</description>

      <title>Edge bits in average symmetry protected topological mixed state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge bit in an average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) mixed state is studied. The state is protected by one strong $Z_2$ and one weak (average) $Z_2$ symmetries. As analogous objects of pure symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, the ASPT possesses edge bits. In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives.</description>

      <title>Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</description>

      <title>Predicting parameters of a model cuprate superconductor using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of calculating phase diagrams for multi-parameter models significantly limits the ability to select parameters that correspond to experimental data. This work presents a machine learning method for solving the inverse problem - forecasting the parameters of a model Hamiltonian for a cuprate superconductor based on its phase diagram. A comparative study of three deep learning architectures was conducted: VGG, ResNet, and U-Net. The latter was adapted for regression tasks and demonstrated the best performance. Training the U-Net model was performed on an extensive dataset of phase diagrams calculated within the mean-field approximation, followed by validation on data obtained using a semi-classical heat bath algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the model accurately predicts all considered Hamiltonian parameters, and areas of low prediction accuracy correspond to regions of parametric insensitivity in the phase diagrams. This allows for the extraction of physically interpretable patterns and validation of the significance of parameters for the system. The results confirm the promising potential of applying machine learning to analyze complex physical models in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Inner structure of the many-body localization transition and the fulfillment of the Harris criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat the disordered Heisenberg model in 1D as the standard model of many-body localization (MBL). Two new and independent order parameters stemming solely from the half-chain von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}$ are introduced to probe the eigenstate phase transition in this model. From the symmetry-endowed entropy decomposition, they are the probability distribution deviation $|d(p_n)|$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ of the maximally dimensional symmetry subdivision. The finite-size scaling reveals that $\{p_n\}$ drives the localization transition, preceded by a thermalization breakdown transition governed by $\{S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}\}$. For the noninteracting case, these transitions coincide, but in the interacting circumstance they separate. Such separability creates an intermediate phase regime and discriminates between the Anderson and MBL transitions. One obstacle whose solution eludes the community to date concerns the violation of the Harris criterion in most numerical investigations of MBL. Upon elucidating the mutually independent measures comprising $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, it becomes clear that the previous studies may lack the resolution to pinpoint thus potentially overlook the crucial internal structure of the transition. We show that after this necessary decomposition, the universal critical exponents for both transitions of $|d(p_n)|$ and $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ fulfill the Harris criterion: $\nu\approx2\ (\nu\approx1.5)$ for quench (quasirandom) disorder. Our work puts forth symmetry combined with entanglement as an organization principle for the generic eigenstate matter and phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), spin-orbit coupling (SOC) produces supersolidity. It is a peculiar state of matter, which, in addition to the superfluid behaviour shows periodic density modulation typical for crystals. Here, we report the fabrication of a new type of optical microcavity allowing to achieve room-temperature supersolidity for a quantum fluid of light. The microcavity is filled with a nematic liquid crystal (LC) and two layers of the organic polymer MeLPPP hosting exciton resonances. We demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in the two distinct degenerate minima of the dispersion created by the LC induced Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) SOC. The condensate real-space distribution shows density stripes located randomly from one condensate realization to another despite the presence of a random disorder potential. This demonstrates the immunity of stripes against disorder (that is, superfluidity) and the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. We also report the random appearance of vortices via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, another smoking gun of superfluidity.</description>

Abstract: Several experimental observations of objects carrying fractional flux quanta in superconductors were recently reported. Here, we provide microscopic solutions for vortices carrying a variable fraction of magnetic flux quantum and domain walls in a three-band $s + is$ superconductor and investigate their properties. We obtain solutions in a fully self-consistent treatment of a microscopic three-band Bogoliubov-de-Gennes model. This demonstrates the characteristic patterns for the magnetic field distribution. The microscopic formalism allows for calculating tunneling conductance that may be used to distinguish fractional vortices from conventional single flux quanta vortices in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein motion within the cell is crucial for predicting reaction rates and macromolecular transport in the cytoplasm. A key question is how crowded environments affect protein dynamics through hydrodynamic and direct interactions at molecular length scales. Using megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EuXFEL), we investigate ferritin diffusion at microsecond time scales. Our results reveal anomalous diffusion, indicated by the non-exponential decay of the intensity autocorrelation function $g_2(q,t)$ at high concentrations. This behavior is consistent with the presence of cage-trapping in between the short- and long-time protein diffusion regimes. Modeling with the $\delta\gamma$-theory of hydrodynamically interacting colloidal spheres successfully reproduces the experimental data by including a scaling factor linked to the protein direct interactions. These findings offer new insights into the complex molecular motion in crowded protein solutions, with potential applications for optimizing ferritin-based drug delivery, where protein diffusion is the rate-limiting step.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of Anderson localization in various disordered media has sustained significant interest over many decades. Specifically, the Anderson localization of phonons has been viewed as a potential mechanism for creating fascinating thermal transport properties in materials. However, despite extensive work, the influence of the vector nature of phonons on the Anderson localization transition has not been well explored. In order to achieve such an understanding, we extend a recently developed phonon dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its typical medium variant (TMDCA) to investigate spectra and localization of multi-branch phonons in the presence of pure mass disorder. We validate the new formalism against several limiting cases and exact diagonalization results. A comparison of results for the single-branch versus multi-branch case shows that the vector nature of the phonons does not affect the Anderson transition of phonons significantly. The developed multi-branch TMDCA formalism can be employed for studying phonon localization in real materials.</description>

Abstract: Spin-orbitronics, based on both spin and orbital angular momentum, presents a promising pathway for energy-efficient memory and logic devices. Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of orbital currents in light transition metals such as Ti, Cr, and Zr, broadening the scope of spin-orbit torque (SOT). In particular, the orbital Hall effect, which arises independently of spin-obit coupling, has shown potential for enhancing torque efficiency in spintronic devices. However, the direct integration of orbital current into magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) remains unexplored. In this work, we design a light metal/heavy metal/ferromagnet multilayer structure and experimentally demonstrate magnetization switching by orbital current. Furthermore, we have realized a robust SOT-MRAM cell by incorporating a reference layer that is pinned by a synthetic antiferromagnetic structure. We observed a tunnel magnetoresistance of 66%, evident in both magnetic field and current-driven switching processes. Our findings underscore the potential for employing orbital current in designing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

Phonons play a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena, from transport to symmetry-breaking orders, such as charge density waves and superconductivity. {Traditionally treated as spin-0 bosons that obey Bose-Einstein statistics,} phonons have recently emerged as a fertile ground for exploring topological physics, spurred by the rapid development of topological band theory initially formulated for fermionic systems. {It is now understood that the phonon eigenstates, characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can carry nontrivial topological invariants, including the Berry phase and Chern number. This new understanding opens up avenues to investigate the interplay between lattice dynamics, topology, and chirality in bosonic systems. In this article, we review recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of topological phonons and circularly polarized phonons. We introduce foundational concepts, including the classification of phononic band structures, symmetry-protected topological phases, and the definition of topological invariants in bosonic systems. We emphasize the concept of phonon angular momentum and its fundamental connection to Weyl phonons in $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking systems. Key experimental progresses on topological and circularly polarized phonons are discussed. We also outline outstanding challenges and promising directions for future research, such as the role of topology in phonon-mediated quasiparticle interactions and the manipulation of phonon angular momentum for potential applications in quantum technologies.}</description>

      <title>Fermion parity switches imprinted in the photonic field of cavity embedded Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a finite-length Kitaev chain coupled to a single mode photonic cavity. The topological phase of the finite-length Kitaev chain is characterized by the presence of fermion parity switching points that correspond to the degeneracy between even and odd parity ground states. Using exact diagonalization, we compute the many-body energy spectrum of the electron-photon Hamiltonian and we find that the ground state in the topological phase of the Kitaev chain is only weakly affected by the cavity coupling. This is in contrast with the excited states showing strong dependence on the cavity frequency. We find that the photon number and the photonic field quadratures peak at values of the chemical potential corresponding to parity switching points revealing a property of the finite-length Kitaev chain in the topological phase. This later finding suggests that quantum optics experiments could be used to detect topological features of the Kitaev chain embedded into a photonic cavity. Moreover, calculations of photonic quadratures reveal squeezed states that are both captured by the exact diagonalization technique and mean field decoupling. However, the mean field approach fails to correctly capture the photonic probability in the odd photonic states.</description>

      <title>Accelerating ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations by delayed update and block force-bias update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become key numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in interacting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the efficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated with the {\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we propose two novel update schemes, the {\it delayed update} and {\it block force-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate ground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\it delayed update}, with a predetermined delay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\it local update}, accelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in the latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\it block force-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update, which is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low acceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high efficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled by the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update schemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard models, demonstrating their speedup over the {\it local update} with respect to the delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across varying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of $\sim$$8$ for systems with $\sim$$1600$ lattice sites. Furthermore, we have investigated the broader applications as well as an application diagram of these update schemes to general correlated fermion systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $T$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $T$ and some other symmetry operation $O$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $O$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations, {which persists at finite temperature}. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate, orthogonally polarized modes and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide intuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an analogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves. Finally, we show that these angular momentum fluctuations produce distinct spectral signatures that can, in principle, be probed via established techniques sensitive to the polarization content and symmetry of lattice excitations, opening an uncharted avenue for accessing and leveraging rotational vacuum correlations in crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Binding and spontaneous condensation of excitons in narrow-gap carbon nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultraclean, undoped carbon nanotubes are observed to be always insulating, even when the gap predicted by band theory is zero: the residual band gap is then thought to have a many-body origin. Here we theoretically show that the correlated insulator is excitonic in $all stable$ narrow-gap tubes irrespective of their size, thus extending our previous claim, limited to gapless (armchair) tubes [D.~Varsano, S.~Sorella, D.~Sangalli, M.~Barborini, S.~Corni, E.~Molinari, M.~Rontani, Nature Communications $\mathbf{8}$, 1461 (2017)]. We derive the scaling law of the exciton binding energy with the tube radius and chirality, and compute self-consistently the fundamental transport gap of the excitonic insulator, by enhancing the two-band model with an accurate treatment of screening validated from first principles. Our findings point to the broader connection between the exciton length scale, dictated by structure, and the stability of the excitonic phase.</description>

      <title>BCS states and D-wave condensates in the 2D Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider states of BCS form in the 2D Hubbard model which, starting from some arbitrary point in state space in the neighborhood of a Hartree-Fock ground state, are relaxed within that BCS ansatz to local minima of the energy. As in the Hartree-Fock approximation there are a vast number of local minima, nearly degenerate in energy. What is new, and unlike the conventional Hartree-Fock states, is that there is a region in parameter space where these local minima are clearly associated with d-wave condensates of the form $d_{x^2-y^2}$ in the underdoped region. There are, however, indications of $d_{xy}$ condensation in the overdoped region, at least in this approximation to the 2D Hubbard model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization. Direct observation of the characteristic altermagnetic spin splitting, however, remains challenging. Indirect signatures can be obtained via transport studies, which so far have only considered homogeneous driving fields. We propose to leverage nonuniform electric fields and spin density gradients to probe the shape and the spin polarization of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces via transport measurements. By using both a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and a lattice Keldysh formalism, we show that altermagnets excite swirling electric and spin currents whose profiles depend on the relative orientation of altermagnetic lobes with respect to the sample boundaries. These currents can be measured via magnetometry techniques. Unlike previous proposals considering the hydrodynamic regime of transport, swirling currents are observed even in the Ohmic regime and rely exclusively on the altermagnetic spin splitting, with no swirls observed in ferromagnets. The electric and spin current vortices predicted here provide a different altermagnetic signature in an experimentally accessible setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex phase diagram of 1T-TiSe2 consists of a charge density wave (CDW) below 200 K, and CDW fluctuations of still unknown origin at higher temperatures. Here, we use time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy and density functional perturbation theory to uncover the formation mechanism of CDW fluctuations and their spectral features at 295 K. We investigated the transient dynamics of fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation, and directly correlate it with the CDW soft-phonon hardening. Surprisingly, our results show that the coherent amplitude mode modulating ultrafast CDW recovery persists above TCDW, and reveal that CDW fluctuations are dominated by the electron-phonon interaction rather than excitonic correlations as commonly believed. Our findings on these microscopic CDW fluctuations clarify the complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, could be useful in understanding the nature of the CDW phase transition in 1T-TiSe2 and similar quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigate the coexistence and competition of electronic orders in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results reveal two coexisting density waves that can be selectively manipulated with light. We directly identify a spin-density wave (SDW) with electronic nematicity emerging below $T_{\rm SDW}$ $\approx$ 140 K by measuring its spin dynamics, and discover a distinct, nonmagnetic charge order appearing below $T_{\rm DW}$ $\approx$ 115 K. The central finding is the demonstration of differential optical control: the charge order is fragile, completely suppressed by a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, while the SDW is remarkably robust, persisting to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$. This work establishes a clear hierarchy in the stability of competing electronic orders and provides a powerful method for disentangling their interplay in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>A configuration interaction approach to solve the Anderson impurity model; applications to elemental Ce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of strongly correlated materials remain a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly due to the computational demand of conventional methods. This paper presents an efficient solver for dynamical mean field theory using configuration interaction (CI). The method is shown to have improved efficiency compared to traditional, exact diagonalization approaches. Hence, it provides an accessible, open-source alternative that can be executed on standard laptop computers or on supercomputers. The solver is demonstrated on cerium in the $\gamma$-, $\alpha$- and $\epsilon$-phases. An analysis of how the electronic structure of Ce evolves as function of lattice compression is made. It is argued that the electronic structure evolves from a localized nature of the 4f shell in $\gamma$-Ce to an essentially itinerant nature of the 4f shell of $\epsilon$-Ce. The transition between these two phases, as function of compression, can hence be seen as a Mott transition. However, this transition is intercepted by the strongly correlated $\alpha$-phase of elemental Ce, for which the 4f shell forms a Kondo singlet.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films represents a significant advance in the field of nickelate superconductor. Motivated by the experimental reports, here we study an 11-band $d-p$ Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations, using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the major superexchange couplings in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films can be substantially weaker than in the bulk material at 29.5 Gpa. Specifically, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is reduced by about 27\% in film, while the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unaffected. We evaluate the corresponding antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$ using perturbation theory. With regard to charge transfer properties, we find that the biaxial compression in films reduces charge transfer gap. We also resolve the orbital distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals, uncovering a pronounced particle-hole asymmetry. Theses findings lay a groundwork for the study of low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and provide key insights into the understanding of physical distinctions between the film and bulk bilayer nickelates.</description>

Abstract: We study diffusive magnetotransport in highly p-doped large area twisted bilayer graphene samples as a function of twist angle, crossing from 1{\deg} (below), to 20{\deg} (above) the van Hove singularity with 7{\deg} and 9{\deg} samples near the van Hove singularity. We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9{\deg} sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity. Further improvements in sample quality and applications to large area moire materials will open new avenues to observe quantum interference effects.</description>

      <title>Enabling the bulk photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric materials through an external electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Chern Insulator at Zero Electric Field in ABCB-Stacked Tetralayer Graphene</title>

Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hybrid confinement techniques for polariton simulators</title>

Abstract: Exciton-polariton III-V semiconductor microcavities provide a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling topological photonics and quantum simulation for advanced photonic functionalities. Here, we introduce two novel fabrication techniques - etch-and-oversputter and deposit-and-oversputter - that overcome limitations of traditional photonic confinement. Both use structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavities to create deep, highly controllable potentials, while leveraging high-quality GaAs-based materials, which achieve excellent Q-factors. A sputtered all-dielectric top mirror introduces an innovative hybrid approach, simplifying fabrication while maintaining quality compared to deep ion etching. Utilizing a Kagome lattice as a benchmark, we show high-quality optical band structures previously inaccessible with deep etching. Furthermore, we study a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice and demonstrate polariton lasing from a zero-dimensional corner mode, confirming precise control over couplings and tight polariton localization. These methods enable fabrication of intricate lattices, including higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum regimes utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism due to tight photonic confinement.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a renormalization group (RG) flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry by interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>
