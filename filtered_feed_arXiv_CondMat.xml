      <title>Wilson-Loop-Ideal Bands and General Idealization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings. In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands. In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge (i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to the realistic model of $3.89^\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moir\'e Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states, respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below $5\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid basis for future study of novel correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Modifying the Optical Emission of Vanadyl Phthalocyanine via Molecular Self-Assembly on van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) is a promising organic molecule for applications in quantum information because of its thermal stability, efficient processing, and potential as a spin qubit. The deposition of VOPc in different molecular orientations allows the properties to be customized for integration into various devices. However, such customization has yet to be fully leveraged to alter its intrinsic properties, particularly optical emission. Normally, VOPc films on dielectric substrates emit a broad photoluminescence peak in the near-infrared range, attributed to transitions in the Pc ring from its pi orbital structure. In this work, we demonstrate that the dominant optical transition of VOPc can be shifted by over 250 meV through the controlled deposition of thin films on van der Waals material substrates. The weak interactions with van der Waals materials allow the molecules to uniquely self-assemble, resulting in modified optical behavior modulated by molecular phase and thickness. This work connects the self-assembling properties of molecules with their altered electronic structures and the resulting optical emission.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall phases in gated rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system of Dirac operators that finds applications as a macroscopic model of spin and valley polarized gated rhombohedral graphene (RHG) with an arbitrary number of layers as well as in replica models of Floquet topological insulators. We classify all quantum anomalous Hall phases that are compatible with the model and show that a bulk-edge correspondence between bulk phases and chiral edge states carrying a quantized anomalous Hall charge applies. When the displacement field is sufficiently small compared to the inter-layer coupling in the RHG application, we retrieve the known phases where the charge is given by the number of graphene layers. When the displacement field increases, we identify all possible topological phase transitions and corresponding quantized chiral edge charges. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Emergent Inductance from Chiral Orbital Currents in a Bulk Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven quantum criticality in two-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals with time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagom\'{e} semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale, signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagom\'{e} QBCP and related materials.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Ambipolar Josephson Current in a Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac surface states in a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced superconductivity offer a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. However, in TIs, the Josephson effect is usually observed in regimes where transport is dominated by either substantial bulk conduction channels or unipolar surface states. In this work, we demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson junction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits pronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it. In contrast, thicker films exhibit a much weaker ambipolar response. Moreover, we find that the supercurrent becomes significantly less resilient to external magnetic fields when the chemical potential is tuned near the Dirac point in both thickness regimes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the ambipolar behavior of these TI JJ devices and attribute the asymmetric supercurrent observed in thicker TI films to the coexistence of Dirac surface states and bulk conduction channels. The demonstration of gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson transport in MBE-grown TI films paves the way for realizing Dirac-surface-state-mediated topological superconductivity and establishes a foundation for future exploration of electrically tunable Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hybridization-Induced Ising-Type Superconductivity in a Confined Gallium Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low-dimensional superconductors, the interplay between quantum confinement and interfacial hybridization effects can reshape Cooper pair wavefunctions and induce novel forms of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we employ a plasma-free, carbon buffer layer-assisted confinement epitaxy method to synthesize trilayer gallium (Ga) sandwiched between a graphene layer and a 6H-SiC(0001) substrate, forming an air-stable graphene/trilayer Ga/SiC heterostructure. In this confined light-element Ga layer, we demonstrate interfacial Ising-type superconductivity driven by atomic orbital hybridization between the Ga layer and the SiC substrate. Electrical transport measurements reveal that the in-plane upper critical magnetic field u0Hc2,|| reaches ~21.98T at T=400 mK, approximately 3.38 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit (~6.51T). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements combined with theoretical calculations confirm the presence of split Fermi surfaces with Ising-type spin textures at the K and K' valleys of the confined Ga layer strongly hybridized with SiC. Moreover, by incorporating finite relaxation time induced by impurity scattering into an Ising-type superconductivity model, we reproduce the entire temperature-dependent u0Hc2,|| phase diagram. This work establishes a new strategy to realize unconventional pairing wavefunctions by combining quantum confinement and interfacial hybridization effects in superconducting thin films. It also opens new avenues for designing scalable superconducting quantum electronic and spintronic devices through interfacial engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantization of spin circular photogalvanic effect in altermagnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekul\'{e}-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Exact many-body wavefunction of the Kondo model with time-dependent interaction strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the nonstationary Schrodinger equation for the Kondo Hamiltonian with a time-dependent spin-exchange coupling $J(t)$ under periodic boundary conditions. Unlike previously studied time-dependent integrable models, which are rooted in the classical Yang-Baxter structure and associated Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, our approach is based on the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov framework and the quantum Yang-Baxter algebra. We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\lambda t + p(t) \pm \sqrt{(\lambda t + p(t))^2 + 4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the corresponding many-body wavefunction. We also discuss extensions to other one-dimensional integrable models with linear dispersion, such as Gross-Neveu and Thirring. Our results broaden the domain of time-dependent integrability to a genuinely quantum class of models and provide a new platform for exploring coherent nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Strain-control of electronic superlattice domains in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metals AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) provide a unique platform to investigate the physics of interacting electrons, a central challenge in condensed matter physics. A key obstacle in unraveling their correlated behavior is to determine which structural and electronic degrees of freedom are involved and how they couple. Here we address this important issue with a novel approach, namely by exploring the strain dependence of electronic superlattices in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Using high-resolution x-ray diffraction, we track the detwinning of the $2\times 2\times 4$ electronic crystal and uncover a gigantic strain response of its domains. We further show that the detwinned $2\times 2\times 4$ phase exhibits an intrinsic 2$\textbf{q}$-modulation and strong mode coupling. Density functional theory reveals that the structural $2\times 2\times 4$ modulation couples strongly to the V $3d$-orbitals, naturally explaining its pronounced strain response. In contrast, the $2\times 2\times 2$ phase at lower temperatures remains essentially unaffected by small uniaxial strain. This dichotomy points to fundamental differences in the symmetry breaking and stabilization mechanisms of the two electronic orders. More specifically, our results provide evidence for the active role of orbital degrees of freedom, which can realize distinct, complex ordering patterns driven by competing interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2 illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg spot with a change in handedness defines a chiral signature for the compensated antiferromagnet that is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric quadrupole (E2) absorption events. E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established MnF2 magnetic symmetry. Spin-flip signals from the magnetic scattering of polarized neutrons depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests of the actual electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Depth Profiling of Oxygen Migration in Ta/HfO2 Stacks During Ionic Liquid Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic liquid (IL) gating has emerged as a powerful tool to control the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials by driving ion motion at solid interfaces. In magneto-ionic systems, electric fields are used to move ions, typically oxygen, from a donor layer into an underlying magnetic metal. Although oxygen distribution is key to enabling precise and stable control in magneto-ionic systems, the spatial distribution and voltage-dependence of oxygen incorporation in such nanoscale stacks remain unknown. Here, we quantify oxygen depth profiles and oxide formation in Si/ SiO2/ Ta (15)/ HfO2 (t) films after IL gating as a function of the gate voltage and HfO2 capping thickness (2 and 3 nm). X-ray reflectivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed a threshold electric field of ~ -2.8 MV/cm to initiate oxygen migration from HfO2 into metallic Ta. The resulting Ta2O5 thickness increases linearly with gate voltage, reaching up to 4 nm at -3 V gating. Notably, the required electric field rises with oxide thickness, indicating a progressively growing barrier for thicker oxide films. The Ta/Ta2O5 interface remains atomically sharp for all gate voltages. This suggests that complete Ta2O5 layers form sequentially before further oxygen penetration, with no sign of deeper diffusion into bulk Ta. Thinner capping layers enhance oxidation, relevant for optimized stack design. Additionally, indium migration from the indium tin oxide electrode to the sample surface was observed, which should be considered for surface-sensitive applications. These insights advance design principles for magneto-ionic and nanoionic devices requiring precise interface engineering.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Ising superconductivity in two archetypal intrinsic superconductors, monolayer 1H-TaS$_2$ and 1H-NbSe$_2$, in a bottom-up approach. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parameterizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, the screened interaction is evaluated microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In direct space, the screened potential displays for both systems long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign. Upon scaling, the oscillation pattern becomes universal, with the periodic features locked to the lattice. Solving the momentum-resolved gap equations, a chiral ground state with p-like symmetry is generically found. Due to the larger Ising spin-orbit coupling, the chiral gap is more anisotropic in TaS$_2$ than in NbSe$_2$. This is reflected in tunneling spectra displaying V-shaped features for the former, in quantitative agreement with low-temperature scanning tunneling experiments on TaS$_2$. At the same time, our results reconcile the apparent discordance with hard gap tunneling spectra reported for the sibling NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and 3D Hopping Conduction at the Surface of FeSb2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of metallic surface states in the d-electron Kondo insulator candidates FeSi and FeSb2, along with some recent reports of magnetic correlations in the surface transport properties of FeSi, we have investigated the low temperature surface magnetotransport properties of FeSb2. By using a Corbino disk transport geometry, we were able to isolate the electrical transport properties of a single surface of our samples and study the [110] and [101] naturally forming faces separately. Studying the relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction and crystal symmetry has allowed us to separate possible contributions to the magnetotransport anisotropy. Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we find no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to current direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to originate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the [100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties of the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at the surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel, which is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong topological insulator.</description>

      <title>Extended Hubbard Model realized in 2D clusters of molecular anions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is remarkably successful at describing numerous many-body phenomena. However, due to the small class of problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t&lt;&lt;U$, occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of realistic fermionic Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering.</description>

      <title>Relation between chiral anomaly and electric transport in $1D$ Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of chiral anomaly and dissipation in one - dimensional Dirac semimetal. For definiteness we consider the Su Schrieffer Heeger (SSH) model, which on the language of lattice field theory represents 1 D Wilson fermions. We employ the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function formalism, and calculate the chiral imbalance and electric conductivity in the presence of energy dissipation, revealing how these observables are connected to the chiral anomaly. By systematically incorporating dissipation effects into the Keldysh framework, we demonstrate how the anomaly-induced contributions manifest in both axial charge density and electric current.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Anisotropic Superconducting Gap in the Kagome Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$: A Study of Directional Point-Contact Andreev Reflection Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recently discovered V-based kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order, raising a fundamental concern on the superconducting gap structure of such kagome superconductors in the presence of CDW orders. Here, we report directional soft point-contact Andreev reflection (SPCAR) spectroscopy measurements on the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, revealing compelling evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic superconducting gap pairing state. The SPCAR spectra measured with current injected parallel to the $ab$-plane exhibit an in-gap single conductance peak, in contrast to those of SPCAR spectra: a double-peak structure in the perpendicular direction. These spectra are well described by an anisotropic single-gap BTK model. The extracted superconducting gaps comprise an isotropic large gap and a strongly anisotropic gap, originating from different Fermi surface sheets. Quantitative analysis reveals an anisotropy around $\ sim$70\% with a gap minimum of about 0.15 meV. These results shed new light on the unconventional multiband pairing states in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-required Orbital Selectivity in Monolayer FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital-selective correlations have been observed to play an important role in Fe-based superconductors. Here, in contrast to previous site-local Mott transition-based origins, we present a band-theory-based mechanism for orbital-selective physics in monolayer FeSe, for which only electron pockets appear. Underlying our mechanism is our density functional theory (DFT)-based observation that, for the electron pockets, antiferromagnetic fluctuations are strongly coupled to electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals but weakly coupled to those in $\{xz,yz\}$ orbitals. Symmetry-arguments reveal that this orbital selective coupling originates from the different intertwined orbital and Fe-site sublattice Bloch wavefunctions for these two sets of orbitals, specifically, the $x^2-y^2$ orbitals can be Fe-site localized. The strong coupling of electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals to the magnetic fluctuations enables orbital-selective electronic renormalizations that can account for important features of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our symmetry-required mechanism for orbital selective physics can be generalized to a range of crystal space groups with four-fold and six-fold screw axes.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature-compatible iron garnet films grown by liquid phase epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films (&lt; 100 nm) form the backbone of magnonics, owing to the record-low losses affecting their magnetization dynamics. However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been investigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses occurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in magnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum information applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial films grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low temperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin films of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300 K temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic GGG. We demonstrate for LPE YIG on YSGG substrates a ferromagnetic resonance linewidth below 1 mT at 3 K, together with a very weak temperature and frequency dependence of the losses. The growth of YIG/YSGG by LPE provides a straightforward approach to producing iron garnet thin films for use in low-temperature investigations.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the composite fermion theory for fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalized composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) by adapting the quantum mechanics approach of CFs. The theoretical framework naturally produces an effective CF Hamiltonian and a wavefunction ansatz, and the Bloch band characteristics of FCIs determine effective scalar and vector potentials experienced by CFs. Our analysis clarifies the construction of CF wavefunctions and state counting in CF phase space, which is subject to a density-of-states correction for filling factors $|\nu| \neq 1/2$. We apply the theory to study the $\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron band or a $2/3$-filled hole band. While both CF models exhibit trends and features consistent with exact diagonalization results, the electron-based model shows better agreement. Furthermore, we find that the FCI phase transition coincides with a topological phase transition in unoccupied CF $\Lambda$-bands.</description>

      <title>Topological Origin of Intrinsic High Chern Numbers in Two-Dimensional M$_2$X$_2$ Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite sharing a common lattice structure, monolayer M$_2$X$_2$ compounds realize quantum anomalous Hall phases with distinct Chern numbers, a striking phenomenon that has not been fully exploared. Combining first-principles calculations with symmetry analysis and tight-binding models, we identify two generic band-inversion mechanisms governed by the orbital composition and symmetry representations of 3$d$ states near the Fermi level. When $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbtials dominate, a doubly degenerate $\Gamma$-point inversion yields $C=1$; otherwise, inversions occur along $\Gamma$-X and $\Gamma$-Y at four $C_4$-related momenta, whose Berry-curvature contributions add to give $C=2$, distinct from scenarios relying on multiple bands inversions at a single $\mathbf{k}$ point. The same mechanism consistently explains related two-dimensional systems, including LiFeSe, KTiSb, MgFeP, and Janus M$_2$X$_2$ derivatives. The mechanism provide practical guidance for screening and engineering tunable high-Chern-number insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, featuring non-relativistic spin splitting, have drawn enormous attention due to their intriguing properties. Here, we investigate the effects of shining bicircularly polarized light (BCL) on altermagnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We discover a remarkable tunability of topology, spin-textures, and Fermi surfaces of altermagnets by means of BCL illumination, going beyond monochromatic light. We illustrate a cascade of topological phase transitions controllable by BCL and demonstrate how these transitions are reflected in the anomalous Hall response of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we show that the spin-textures and Fermi surfaces can be directly tuned by the relative phase of the BCL, stemming from the underlying symmetry changes. Our findings can pave the way for effectively controlling altermagnetic materials with structured light.</description>

      <title>An Approach to the Quantum Hall Effect in Three- Dimensional Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems. This extends our previous single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to two-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene, where insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional sequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization, we generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and high mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE. For 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an effective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large effective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the calculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical expressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall conductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical predictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states. Simulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations under realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D semimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron Landau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This provides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions, highlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The model further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport properties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasidegenerate charge-density wave states in 1T-TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides have been actively studied for their intriguing charge density wave (CDW) formations and their impacts on material properties. Among these, 1T-TiSe$_2$ is well-known to exhibit a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW state transition at 200 K, but its true ground state nature remains under debate. In this study, we investigate possible CDW states in 1T-TiSe$_2$ and their consequences for transport properties by employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We identify seven distinct types of 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phases, most of which have not been reported previously. All of these phases are nearly degenerate in energy with each other ($&lt; 1.41$ meV per formula unit). Using the band unfolding technique, we compare the electronic band structures of these CDW phases with experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data. Our findings support the presence of a possible second phase transition at 165 K and suggest a new intermediate CDW order between 165 and 200 K that was previously unexplored. This result provides a possible resolution to the conflict between previous reports on the ground state symmetry of 1T-TiSe$_2$, and opens a viable route to phase engineering of 1T-TiSe$_2$ for functional applications.</description>

      <title>Mexican hat-like valence band dispersion and quantum confinement in rhombohedral ferroelectric alpha-In2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a large variety of electronic properties depending on chemical composition, number of layers and stacking-order. Among them, alpha-In2Se3 has attracted much attention due to the promise of outstanding electronic properties, attractive quantum physics, in- and out-of-plane ferroelectricity and high photo-response. Precise experimental determination of the electronic structure of rhombohedral (3R) alpha-In2Se3 is needed for a better understanding of potential properties and device applications. Here, combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that 3R alpha-In2Se3 phase exhibits a robust inversion of the valence band parabolicity at the Gamma point forming a bow-shaped dispersion with a depth of 140 +- 10 meV between the valence band maximum (VBM) along the GammaK direction of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Moreover, we unveil an indirect band gap of about 1.25 eV, as well as a highly electron doping of approximatively 5.1012 electrons per cmsquare at the surface. This leads to surface band bending and the formation of a prominent electron accumulation layer. These findings allow a deeper understanding of the rhombohedral alpha-In2Se3 electronic properties underlying the potential of III/VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>GPUTB: Efficient Machine Learning Tight-Binding Method for Large-Scale Electronic Properties Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high computational cost of ab-initio methods limits their application in predicting electronic properties at the device scale. Therefore, an efficient method is needed to map the atomic structure to the electronic structure quickly. Here, we develop GPUTB, a GPU-accelerated tight-binding (TB) machine learning framework. GPUTB employs atomic environment descriptors, enabling the model parameters to incorporate environmental dependence. This allows the model to transfer to different basis, xc-functionals, and allotropes easily. Combined with the linear scaling quantum transport method, we have calculated the electronic density of states for up to 100 million atoms in pristine graphene. Trained on finite-temperature structures, the model can be easily extended to millions of atom finite-temperature systems. Furthermore, GPUTB can also successfully describe h-BN/graphene heterojunction systems, demonstrating its capability to handle complex material with high precision. We accurately reproduce the relationship between carrier concentration and room temperature mobility in graphene to verify the framework's accuracy. Therefore, our GPUTB framework presents a delicate balance between computational accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful computational tool for investing electronic properties for large systems with millions of atoms.</description>

      <title>Silicon-Compatible Ionic Control over Multi-State Magnetoelectric Phase Transformations in Correlated Oxide System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, critical enablers for low-power spintronics, is fundamentally challenged by the long-standing trade-off between ferromagnetic ordering and indirect exchange interactions in insulators. Ionic evolution offers tempting opportunities for accessing exotic magnetoelectric states and physical functionality beyond conventional doping paradigm via tailoring the charge-lattice-orbital-spin interactions. Here, we showcase the precise magneto-ionic control over magnetoelectric states in LSMO system, delicately delivering silicon-compatible weakly ferromagnetic insulator state above room temperature. Of particular note is the decoupling of ion-charge-spin interplay in correlated LSMO system, a primary obstacle in clarifying underlying physical origin, with this process concurrently giving rise to an emergent intermediate state characterized by a weakly ferromagnetic half-metallic state. Benefiting from the SrTiO3 buffer layer as epitaxial template to promote interfacial heterogeneous nucleation, hydrogenation enables diverse magnetoelectric states in LSMO integrated on silicon, fully compatible with traditional semiconductor processing. Assisted by theoretical calculations and spectroscopic techniques, hydrogen-induced magnetoelectric transitions in LSMO are driven by band-filling control and suppression in double exchange interaction. Our work not only defines a novel design paradigm for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated system, with transformative potential for spintronics, but also fundamentally unveils the physical origin behind ionic evolution via disentangling the ion-charge-spin coupling.</description>

      <title>Evolution of spin excitations in superconducting La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ from the underdoped to the heavily overdoped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate high-energy spin excitations in hole-doped La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ films across a broad Ca doping range $x = 0.05-0.50$ using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Polarization analysis and incident-photon energy detuning measurements confirm the persistence of collective paramagnon excitations up to $x = 0.50$. Consistent with previous studies on other cuprate families, we observe a pronounced crossover near $x = 0.15$, where paramagnon spectral weight is transferred to incoherent spin-flip excitations associated with the particle-hole continuum. The overall behavior of paramagnons in LCCO resembles that in other hole-doped cuprates and appears insensitive to the persistence of superconductivity at high doping levels in LCCO - up to at least $x = 0.50$, as demonstrated in prior work. These findings support the view that high-energy magnetic excitations probed by RIXS are not a major contributor to superconducting pairing, in line with theories of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Trigonal distortion in the Kitaev candidate honeycomb magnet BaCo2(AsO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Co $L_{2,3}$ edges on single crystals of the Kitaev candidate honeycomb lattice compound BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. The measurements employed the inverse partial fluorescence yield technique, which is ideal for acquiring reliable x-ray absorption spectra from highly insulating samples, enabling precise quantitative analysis. Our experimental results revealed a significant linear dichroic signal, indicating strong trigonal distortion in the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. We performed a detailed analysis of the experimental XAS and XMCD spectra using a full-multiplet configuration-interaction cluster model. This analysis unveiled that the $t_{2g}$ hole density is predominantly localized in the $a_{1g}$ orbital. Through XMCD sum rules and theoretical calculations, we quantified both the spin and orbital magnetic moments. Our study demonstrates that the local electronic structure of the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra displays an effective trigonal distortion of approximately $-0.114$ eV. This distortion is larger than the Co $3d$ spin-orbit coupling constant, emphasizing the crucial impact of local structural distortions on the electronic and magnetic properties of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in biaxial-strain detwinned $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ has been a leading candidate for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL), but its intrinsic spin dynamics have remained obscured by crystal twinning. Here we apply biaxial anisotropic strain to detwin $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ single crystals and directly visualize the intrinsic magnetic excitations using inelastic neutron scattering. We discover that the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the magnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes stringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined, quantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state and its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation continua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\Gamma$ is consistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a sixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\sim 16$ meV that cannot be explained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of fractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics. Our findings establish biaxial strain as a powerful symmetry-breaking probe to access the intrinsic spin dynamics of Kitaev materials and provide critical benchmarks for refining theoretical models of quantum magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing materials, but also enable realizing properties that are not present in any constituent region of the considered heterostructure. Here we reveal an unexplored altermagnetic proximity effect (AMPE), distinct from its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts. Using first-principles and model analyses of van der Waals heterostructures based on the prototypical altermagnet V$_2$Se$_2$O, we show that its hallmark momentum-alternating spin splitting can be directly imprinted onto adjacent nonmagnetic layers -- a process we term altermagnetization. This is demonstrated in a monolayer PbO through characteristic band splitting and real-space spin densities, with systematic dependence on interlayer spacing and magnetic configuration. We further predict broader AMPE manifestations: Valley-selective spin splitting in a monolayer PbS and a topological superconducting phase in monolayer NbSe$_2$, both inheriting the alternating $k$-space spin texture of the altermagnet. These results establish AMPE not only as a distinct proximity mechanism, but also as a powerful method of using altermagnetism in designing emergent phenomena and versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Oxygen-driven altermagnetic symmetry inducing d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates and nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity, numerous theoretical frameworks have been proposed; Anderson's RVB picture (Science 235, 1196-1198, 1987) and U(1) gauge theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996) motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By contrast, altermagnetism (Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022) yields a d-wave-like k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4 (the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like Delta(k). Since orthorhombic tilts are not the driver (and even suppress superconductivity in nickelates; Nature 621, 493, 2023), we then show that the in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers - ubiquitous in cuprates and nickelates - intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4 symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While the microscopic origin remains open, we outline possible scenarios, and our real-space construction maps directly onto lattice models, placing superconductivity and Hubbard physics on the same footing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced Moir\'e Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect in a four-site Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model across clean and disordered regimes using exact numerical technique of a four-site lattice under Lindblad dynamics with local dephasing noise. By systematically varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder, we probe relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and $\ell_1$-norm of coherence metrics. Our results reveal that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to the pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be particularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Towards effective models for low-dimensional cuprates: From ground state Hamiltonian reconstruction to spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding which minimal effective model captures the essential physics of cuprates is a key step towards unraveling the mechanism behind high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor (DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by $t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates.</description>

      <title>Neutron Reflectometry by Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the $\eta$ symmetry of the pump-induced $\eta$-pairing state in the Hubbard chain can be transiently broken by an additionally applied probe pulse. This leads to characteristic dynamic Higgs oscillations of the $\eta$-pair correlations during the probe pulse and a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega;t)$, which appears above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega&gt;\Delta_{\rm c}$, long after the pump pulse is finished. This negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega;t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from parameter regimes dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. Remarkably, the broadband probe pulse then leads to the emission of photons with the Higgs frequency.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point with emergent spin-orbit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interface-induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T-CrTe2 layer, a two-dimensional ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto-chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional spin helix and magnon-induced singularity in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits prominent correlated phenomena in two distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a quasi-two-dimensional spin helix phase within the localized spins emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means and by adjusting the twist angle. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures.</description>

Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the Kitaev model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator RuCl3. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review begins with a brief review on QSLs in other systems, followed by a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on RuCl3. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</description>

      <title>Selective Kondo screening and strange metallicity by sliding Dirac semimetals</title>

Abstract: Kondo screening of local moments in normal metals typically leads to hybridized conduction and valence bands separated by a Kondo gap, resulting in an insulating state at half-band filling. We show a dramatic change of this scenario in a Dirac-semimetal-based correlated system -- a bilayer honeycomb lattice heterostructure where the local moment lattice is stacked on a Dirac semimetal breaking the inversion symmetry. This system is modeled by an extended Anderson honeycomb lattice involving the real-space dependence of major interlayer hybridization parameters on the relative sliding distance along the armchair direction. First, we unveil the multiple Kondo scales and the successive Kondo breakdown transitions in this correlated heterostructure under sliding. Second, we demonstrate the existence of a genuine selective Kondo screening phase which is stabilized near the A-B stack pattern and is accessible by applying the interlayer voltage. Third, we find a nearly flat hybridized band located concomitantly within the Kondo gap, resulting in an unprecedented metallic state at the half-band filling. This unconventional heavy fermion state is characterized by the violation of Luttinger theorem and the appearance of a Van Hove singularity at the Fermi energy. The general sliding-driven band structure landscape and the implications of our results for the broad context of multiorbital Kondo physics are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Molecules with an odd number of electrons typically display paramagnetic behaviour in a uniform magnetic field. Single-molecule toroics -- a family of open shell lanthanide complexes -- instead display an unprecedented vanishing magnetization. The anomaly is reconciled by degenerate quantum states where electron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, that carry a vanishing magnetic dipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric manipulation, toroidal moments have attracted interest for spintronic, magnonic, and photonic applications. While macroscopic toroidal moments feature in some extended systems, molecular toroidal states have yet to be observed, as it remains unclear how existing experimental set-ups could split degenerate states carrying counter-rotating vortices. We propose a realistic pulsed radiation protocol to polarise and observe molecular toroidal moments in a class of MDy$_6$ (M = Al$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$) molecules with coupled Dy$_3$ toroidal moieties. Three resonant MW-pulses -- delivered sequentially or simultaneously -- selectively and coherently transfers population to a long-lived toroidally-polarised state whose ensuing magneto-electric properties provide a read-out mechanism. Our results provide a strategy to measure and coherently manipulate toroidal states in molecular systems, which is expected to trigger applications of molecular toroidal states to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.</description>

Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the kagome lattice to improve understanding of ARPES in CoSn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic kagome lattices are attracting significant attention as they provide a platform to explore the interplay between topology and magnetism. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) plays a key role in unraveling their electronic structure. However, the analysis is often challenging due to the presence of multiple bands near the Fermi level. Indeed, each orbital generates three bands in a kagome lattice due to its three sites motif, which soon becomes complicated if many orbitals are present. To address this complexity, using ARPES matrix elements can be highly beneficial. First, band symmetry can be determined through selection rules based on light polarization. We emphasize that, in kagome lattices, as in all multi-site lattices, symmetry of the Bloch state is not only determined by the orbital character but also by the relative phase between the three sublattices. Additionally, interference between the three sublattices leads to a strong modulation of ARPES intensity across neighboring Brillouin zones. We show how unfolded band calculations capture these modulations, helping with band identification. We apply these ideas to CoSn, whose simple structure retains the key features of a kagome lattice. Using polarization dependent ARPES in several Brillouin zones, we isolate the dispersion of each band and discuss novel correlation effects, selectively renormalizing the bands crossing the Fermi level and shifting the others.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phases of triangular graphene quantum
  dots (TGQDs) with zigzag edges using variational and quantum Monte
  Carlo methods. These systems serve as quantum simulators for
  bipartite lattices with broken sublattice symmetry, providing a
  platform to study the extended Hubbard model's emergent magnetic
  phenomena, including Lieb's magnetism at half-filling, edge
  depolarization upon single-electron addition, and Nagaoka
  ferromagnetism. Our non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations,
  performed for lattices of up to 61 sites, reveal that TGQDs
  transition from metallic to insulating regimes as a function of site
  radius size, while retaining edge-polarized ground states at
  half-filling. Notably, edge depolarization occurs upon
  single-electron doping in both metallic and insulating phases,
  contrasting with the Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in hexagonal
  armchair geometries.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets, with spin splitting and vanishing magnetization, have been attributed to many fascinating phenomena and potential applications. In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention. However, its experimental realization and precise spin manipulation remain elusive. Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>

Abstract: The coupling between real-space inhomogeneities coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states -- energetically isolated within the bulk band gap -- emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr_2Se_2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the N\'eel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experiments.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</description>
