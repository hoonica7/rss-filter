      <title>SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e materials, we propose TMD moir\'e multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Spectral Function of Moir\'e Graphene Heavy-Fermions Using Iterative Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral functions of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) in the absence of strain have recently been investigated in both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The theoretically predicted Mott-Hubbard bands and gapless semimetallic state at half-filling have since been confirmed experimentally. Here, we develop several second-order perturbation theory approaches to the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of TBG and twisted symmetric trilayer graphene (TSTG). In the symmetric phase, we adapt, implement, and benchmark an iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver within DMFT, enabling computationally efficient yet accurate spectral function calculations. We present momentum- and energy-resolved spectra over a broad range of temperatures and fillings for both symmetric and symmetry-broken states. In addition, we derive analytic expressions for the spectral function within the ``Hubbard-I'' approximation of the THF model and, as expected, find that while it provides a tractable description of Mott physics, it does not capture the low-energy Kondo peak or the finite lifetime broadening of the bands. Our methodology can be extended to include strain, lattice relaxation, and parameter variations, thereby allowing systematic predictions of TBG and TSTG spectral properties across a wide range of physical regimes. Because our perturbative approaches are far less computationally intensive than DMFT with numerically exact impurity solvers, they can be used to efficiently benchmark and scan extensive phase diagrams of the THF parameters, paving the way for full DMFT analyses of the TBG spectral function in the presence of strain and relaxation.</description>

      <title>Cyclo-Graphyne: A Highly Porous and Semimetallic 2D Carbon Allotrope with Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of Cyclo-graphyne (CGY), an emerging 2D carbon allotrope with a porous structure of sp/sp$^2$-hybridized carbon atoms. Using density functional theory, we systematically investigate its structural, energetic, dynamical, thermal, electronic, mechanical, optical, and vibrational properties. The calculated cohesive and formation energies are both comparable to those of other synthesized graphynes, confirming its energetic viability. Phonon dispersion calculations confirm its dynamical stability, while ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate thermal stability up to at least 1000 K. Electronic results reveal that CGY is a semimetal with an ultranarrow band gap and features two Dirac cones in its electronic structure. Mechanically, CGY is highly compliant and isotropic, exhibiting a Young's modulus an order of magnitude lower than that of graphene. The optical spectrum reveals strong ultraviolet absorption and infrared reflectivity with an isotropic response, while the vibrational spectra show distinct Raman peaks and rich infrared activity. These properties position CGY as a promising candidate for future applications in areas such as gas capture and separation, flexible nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>The Frenkel line and the pseudogap: an analogy between classical and electronic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotically close to critical end-points of first-order transitions, maxima in thermodynamic quantities occur along a line called the Widom line, a concept first introduced in classical fluids. This concept has been extended to strongly correlated electronic fluids in the context of the Mott transition. Namely, upon increasing interaction strength in the Hubbard model at half-filling, one finds a first-order Mott metal-insulator transition with a critical end-point at high temperature above which a number of crossover lines are observable. Using the dynamical cluster approximation for the triangular-lattice Hubbard model, we compute the Frenkel line, another concept borrowed from classical fluids, useful to define a sharp crossover between the pseudogap and the correlated Fermi liquid. The Frenkel line in the electron fluid is defined by the appearance of back-scattering when entering the pseudogap. The signature of back-scattering is the existence of a negative value in the time-domain optical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings in weak localization of spin-orbit coupled graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak localization theory is developed for graphene heterostructures with transition metal dichalcogenides and topological insulators where the Rashba and valey-Zeeman spin-splittings of the energy spectrum are large enough. The anomalous magnetoresistance in low fields caused by weak localization is calculated. It is shown that the valley-Zeeman splitting has no effect on weak localization in the absence of Rashba splitting but it results in the change of the magnetoconductivity sign in the Rashba-coupled graphene. Inter-valley scattering also affects the quantum correction to the conductivity resulting in its sign reversal. Analytical expressions are obtained for the anomalous magnetoconductivity at arbitrary relations between the Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings as well as the inter-valley scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate magnetic order drives singular angular magnetoresistance in a Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a multi-$\mathbf{k}$ incommensurate magnetic state in the Weyl semimetal CeAlGe gives rise to singular angular magnetoresistance (SAMR), an electrical-transport signature that detects the magnetic-field direction with exceptional precision. In contrast, the sister compound CeAlSi shows neither multi-$\mathbf{k}$ order nor SAMR. Both phenomena emerge upon $\sim57\%$ Ge substitution in CeAlSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ and coincide with electronic-structure changes that soften the single-ion in-plane anisotropy and enhance Weyl-mediated magnetic interactions. These results reveal a direct connection between band topology, electronic transport, and collective magnetism in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Localized Excitons and Landau-Level Mixing in Time-Reversal Symmetric Pairs of Chern Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Landau-level mixing in a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian composed of two sets of Landau levels with opposite magnetic field, relevant to moir\'e minibands in twisted homobilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in the adiabatic limit, where electrons in opposite valleys have flat Chern bands with opposite Chern numbers. Strong spin-orbit coupling polarizes spins in opposite directions in opposite valleys, separating Coulomb interactions into like-spin ($V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$) and opposite-spin ($V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$). Using degenerate perturbation theory, we compute Landau-level mixing corrections to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ and $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ for different filling fractions. In the lowest Landau level, screening exhibits an even-odd effect: $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ is reduced more strongly than $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ in even-$m$ angular momentum Haldane pseudopotential and less strongly in odd-$m$ angular momentum ones. In the first Landau level, the short-range part ($m=0,1$) of $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ is reduced comparably to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$, while the strongest spin anisotropy appears in the $m=2$ pseudopotential. These novel short-range spin correlations have important implications for candidate correlated phases of fractional quantum spin Hall insulators. A distinctive feature of this time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian, absent in conventional quantum Hall systems, is that spin-flip excitations form localized quasiparticles. We compute their excitation spectrum and predict a non-monotonic dependence of the ordering temperature of Chern ferromagnetism in MoTe$_2$ on the Landau-level mixing parameter.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of coherent nodal and antinodal dynamics in underdoped Bi-2212</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest (respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over 44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly faster decoherence ($&lt;$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of RCd3P3 (R: Ce or La) compounds: Insulator-metal transition induced by displacement of atoms in the unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the electronic structures and optical properties of single crystals of RCd3P3 (R = Ce or La). Our first-principles analysis indicates that CeCd3P3 and LaCd3P3 exhibit semiconductor characteristics with narrow energy gaps of approximately 0.51 and 0.70 eV, respectively. Notably, a slight displacement of the Cd and P atoms within the unit cell significantly transforms the electronic structure from insulating to metallic state. Optical spectroscopy of both compounds reveals a metallic state with a low charge carrier density, suggesting a finite density of states at the Fermi level. A comparison between the theoretical electronic structures and experimental optical properties elucidates the observed metallic behavior. Additionally, the notable modification of the infrared-active phonons strongly indicates a structural phase transition in these compounds. Our findings also suggest that CeCd3P3 serves as a suitable platform for investigating the photoinduced Kondo effect due to its metallic ground state with limited charge carriers.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-point-induced dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, the existence of exceptional points (EPs) depends not only on the details of the Hamiltonian but also on the particle-number filling and the particle statistics. In this paper, we study many-particle EPs in a Bose Hubbard chain with two end-site resonant imaginary potentials. Starting from a single-particle coalescing eigenstate, we construct $n$-particle condensate eigenstates for the cases with zero and infinite $U$. Compared with the free bosonic case, where the $ n $-particle condensate eigenstate is an $(n+1)$-th-order coalescing state, the hardcore-boson counterpart is a second-order coalescing state for odd $n$ , while it is not for even $n$. The difference in particle-number parity results in distinct quenching dynamics of the condensate states, highlighting the role of parity in system behavior. Our finding may stimulate research on the dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous and Topological Hall Effect and Nernst Effect in a Dirac Kagome Magnet Fe3Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for kagome magnets with unconventional magnetic and electronic properties has gained significant attention in recent years. We report the magnetic, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of Fe3Ge single crystals, where the Fe atoms form a slightly distorted kagome lattice. Fe3Ge exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect and anomalous Nernst effect. The anomalous transverse thermoelectric conductivity reaches about 4.6 A m^-1 K^-1, exceeding values reported for conventional ferromagnets and most topological ferromagnets. First-principles calculations indicate that these transport responses are primarily governed by intrinsic mechanisms, highlighting the dominant role of Berry curvature arising from massive Dirac gaps in momentum space. In addition, we observe a topological Hall resistivity of about 0.9 microOhm cm and a topological Nernst coefficient of 1.2 microvolt K^-1, which are attributed to the Berry phase associated with field-induced scalar spin chirality. These findings demonstrate the combined influence of Berry phases in both momentum and real space, establishing Fe3Ge as a promising candidate for room-temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Evidence for Electron-Boson Coupling in Half-metallic CrO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the electronic structure of the half-metal ferromagnet CrO2 by means of high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The observed clear Fermi surface (FS) and band dispersion are in good agreement with the previous reports. Moreover, the ARPES band dispersion reveals a distinct kink structure around 68 meV, providing the first evidence from the electronic structure for the elementary excitations in CrO2. The energy scale of this feature is comparable to the Debye temperature and the A1g phonon mode, suggesting the electron-phonon interaction. From the detailed analysis, we have extracted the self-energy and found two characteristic structures in the real part of the self-energy. Assuming the existence of the electron-magnon interaction as well as the electron-phonon interaction, we have simulated the line shape for the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy and reproduced the ARPES intensity. Our spectral findings demonstrate the renormalized quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in CrO2 and provide valuable insights into the fundamental many-body interactions governing half-metallic ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ordering in Moir\'e Graphene Multilayers from a Continuum Hartree+U Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, symmetry-broken ground states, such as correlated insulating states, magnetic order and superconductivity, have been discovered in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) near the so-called magic-angle. Understanding the magnetic order in these systems is challenging, as atomistic methods become extremely expensive near the magic angle and continuum approaches fail to capture important atomistic details. In this work, we develop a self-consistent approach based on a continuum model that incorporates both short-ranged Hubbard interactions and long-ranged Coulomb interactions, therefore allowing efficient exploration of magnetic order in moir\'e graphene multilayers. With this approach, we perform a systematic analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of tBLG as a function of doping level and twist angle, near the magic angle. We find that the results are consistent with previous perturbative atomistic Hartree+U calculations. Furthermore, we predict stable magnetic orders for the tTLG. We found that the magnetic orders are similar to those in tBLG for small values of on-site repulsion. In the future, the developed method can be utilized to investigate magnetic ordering tendencies from short-range exchange interactions in other moir\'e graphene multilayers as a function of doping, twist angle, screening environment, among other variables.</description>

      <title>Layer controlled orbital selective Mott transition in monolayer nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality and electronic correlations are crucial elements of many quantum material properties. An example is the change of the electronic structure accompanied by the loss of quasiparticles when a metal is reduced from three dimensions to a lower dimension, where the Coulomb interaction between carriers becomes poorly screened. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we report an orbital-selective decoherence of spectral density in the perovskite nickelate LaNiO3 towards the monolayer limit. The spectral weight of the dz2 band vanishes much faster than that of the dx2-y2 band as the thickness of the LaNiO3 layer is decreased to a single unit cell, indicating a stronger correlation effect for the former upon dimensional confinement. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations show an orbital-selective Mott transition largely due to the localization of dz2 electrons along the c axis in the monolayer limit. This orbital-selective correlation effect underpins many macroscopic properties of nickelates, such as metal-to-insulator transition and superconductivity, where most theories are built upon a dx2-y2-dz2 two-band model.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric quantum oscillations and Zeeman splitting in topological Dirac semimetal BaAl$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional topological semimetals hosting Dirac or Weyl fermions are a new kind of materials class in which conduction and valence bands cross each other. Such materials harbor a nontrivial Berry phase, which is an additional geometrical phase factor arising along the path of an adiabatic surface and can give rise to experimentally measurable quantities such as an anomalous Hall component. Here we report a systematic study of quantum oscillations of thermoelectric power in single crystals of the topological Dirac nodal-line semimetal BaAl$_{4}$. We show that the thermoelectric power (TEP) is a sensitive probe of the multiple oscillation frequencies in this material, with two of these frequencies shown to originate from the three-dimensional Dirac band. The detected Berry phase provides evidence of the angular dependence and non-trivial state under high magnetic fields. We also have probed the signatures of Zeeman splitting, from which we have extracted the Land\'e $g$-factor for this system, providing further insight into the non-trivial topology of this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Selective Band Structure Evolution in BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$ (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Ru and Mn) Probed by Polarization-Dependent ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the evolution of the band structure in the Fe-based superconductor family BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$ (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Ru and Mn) using polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Low-substituted samples, with comparable spin-density wave transition temperatures ($T_\text{SDW}$), were chosen to facilitate controlled comparisons. The sizes of the central hole pockets ($\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$) remain largely unchanged across different substitutions, showing no clear correlation with either $T_\text{SDW}$ or the As height relative to the Fe planes. However, subtle trends are observed: a modest increase in the size of the $\eta_\text{X}$ electron pocket correlates with the suppression of $T_\text{SDW}$. Furthermore, the contraction of the $\eta_\text{X}$ pocket appears to be linked to an increase in the As height relative to the Fe planes. Our results suggest that the suppression of $T_\text{SDW}$ is primarily driven by changes in the Fe-As bond length, with the effect being more pronounced in electronic states with planar character. These findings provide insight into the electronic structure of BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations between excitonic and quantum spin Hall insulators in moir\'e WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) and excitonic insulators (EIs) are prototypical topological and correlated states of matter, respectively. The topological phase transition between the two has attracted much theoretical interest but experimental studies have been hindered by the availability of tunable materials that can access such a transition. Here, by utilizing the interaction-enhanced g-factor and the flat moir\'e bands in twisted bilayer WSe2 (tWSe2), we realize tunable electron-like and hole-like Landau levels (LLs) in the opposite valleys of tWSe2 under a perpendicular magnetic field. At half-band-filling, which corresponds to electron-hole charge neutrality, periodic oscillations between QSHIs (for fully filled LLs) and EIs (for half-filled LLs) are observed due to the interplay between the cyclotron energy and the intervalley correlation; QSHIs with up to four pairs of helical edge states can be resolved. We further analyze the effect of Fermi surface nesting on the stability of EIs via electric field-tuning of the moir\'e band structure. Our results demonstrate a novel QSHI-to-EI topological phase transition and provide a comprehensive understanding of the fermiology of tWSe2.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping transport in the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model is a simple low energy and long wavelength description of charge transport, parameterised by the current relaxation timescale $\tau$, charge diffusivity $D$ and charge compressibility $\chi$. We obtain sharp constraints on these parameters in terms of the microscopic energy and length scales of any underlying lattice model with local and bounded interactions. Our primary tools are upper bounds on the retarded Green's function for the charge density in such a setting. We first note that the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model cannot pertain at microscopic energy scales because it is inconsistent with the exponential suppression of spectral weight at the highest frequencies in a lattice model. Secondly, under the assumption that the low energy dynamics is captured by the model, we obtain a lower bound on the collective mean free path $\ell \equiv \sqrt{\tau D}$. This bound is shown to imply a version of the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound: systems with $\ell$ much shorter than the lattice length scale cannot have conventional Drude peaks.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray Ptychography with SOPHIE: Guide and Instrumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft X-ray ptychography is becoming a key synchrotron microscopy technique in the fields of condensed matter physics, chemistry, environmental and life sciences. Its attractiveness across broad disciplinary fields is owed to the favorable combination of high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms. The SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) was developed to accommodate soft X-ray ptychography experiments requiring high spatial resolution, in addition to high chemical and ferroic sensitivities. An introduction to soft X-ray ptychography with SOPHIE aimed at prospective users is provided. Furthermore, an overview of the instrumentation of SOPHIE is given along with an example of the imaging capabilities, which demonstrate the achievement of a sub-5 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV.</description>

      <title>Magnon-photon coupling in the YIG-based disk and ring microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible. Strategies for further improvements of interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sodium-Decorated Ennea-Graphene: A Novel 2D Carbon Allotrope for High-Capacity Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of safe, efficient, and reversible hydrogen storage materials is critical for advancing hydrogen-based energy technologies and achieving carbon-neutral goals. Ennea-Graphene, a new 2D carbon allotrope made of 4-, 5-, 6-, and mainly 9-membered carbon rings (nonagons), is introduced via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that the monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable at 300 K, as no imaginary modes are detected. The pristine system further exhibits metallic-like electronic behavior. The material exhibits high in-plane stiffness (Young modulus of 255 N/m). Sodium adsorption at the centers of the nonagonal rings is energetically favorable, with a binding energy of approximately -1.56 eV, leading to the formation of the Na@Ennea-Graphene complex. The calculated H2 adsorption energies range from -0.15 eV to -0.18 eV. The Na-decorated structure demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage performance, reversibly adsorbing up to four H2 molecules per Na atom (8.8 wt\% H2). This capacity surpasses the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 target for onboard hydrogen storage materials. The adsorbed H2 remains molecular (H-H bond of 0.76~\AA) and can be released under near-ambient conditions, as verified by 300 K ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings position sodium-decorated Ennea-Graphene as a promising nanomaterial for next-generation hydrogen storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Mott Gap Softening Coinciding with Spin Correlations Collapse in a-RuCl3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.</description>

Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization, where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. By solving exactly a disordered electronic lattice model out of equilibrium, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization in an open system, and provide a minimal platform to study disorder-nonequilibrium interplay in electronic lattice systems. We perform steady-state Keldysh Green's function calculations on an infinite lattice with a finite-range of disorder-active region that are coupled to fermion reservoirs. Our solutions out of a fully electronic model verify Mott's temperature scaling of the variable-range-hopping transport and the Lifshitz tail, well-corroborated by the coherent-potential approximation. We further reveal that a nonequilibrium electronic lattice creates a statistical evolution that shows a counterintuitive shift of the distribution edge in the opposite direction of the band edge. The rich evolution of non-thermal statistics highlights the importance of an explicit band structure and the impurity correlations in strong nonequilibrium theories.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced Diffusion Transport in Flat-band Systems with Quantum Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous understanding of transport in disordered system depends on the assumption that there is a well-defined Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in the system such as the diffusion length and localization length. However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a 1D Lieb lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation.</description>

Abstract: We study an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant Fermi-Hubbard gas undergoing on-site three-body losses. The model presents eight independent strong symmetries preventing the complete depletion of the gas. By making use of a basis of semi-standard Young tableaux states, we reveal the presence of a rich phenomenology of stationary states. We classify the latter according to the irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ to which they belong. We finally discuss the presence of three-particle stationary states that are not protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a disordered-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our disordered-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta &lt; W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field by extending Mott's variable range hopping. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quenched disorder can destroy magnetic order, for example when a random field is applied in a 2-dimensional Ising model. Even when an order exists in the presence of quenched disorder, it is usually only the survival of the order of the clean model. We present here a surprising phenomenon where an order emerges, driven by quenched disorder. This order has nothing in common with the order present in the clean model. This type of \textit{order by disorder} differs from the usual thermal or quantum one. The classical $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is studied by parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, with site dilution. After analyzing the effect of a few vacancies on the ground state, favoring non-coplanar configurations, we show the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the collinear $q=4$ Potts order, the only order present in the absence of vacancies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice at finite temperatures, combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>1D Transition Metal Oxide Chains as a Challenging Model for Ab Initio Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge {\it ab initio} calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard $U$ parameter for DFT+$U$ is determined using the linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima -- primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d-orbitals -- leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+U, and Hartree-Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+$U$ and PBE. We analyze the electronic band structures and find that while the PBE approximation often predicts metallic or half-metallic ground states for the ferromagnetic (FM) state, DFT+$U$ approach successfully opens band gaps, correctly predicting insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+$U$ and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+$U$, suggesting that the Hubbard $U$ parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+$U$ and PBE methods.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moir\'es using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moir\'e materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moir\'e bands. For small twists ($\lesssim 5^\circ$) the density of states versus filling and interlayer bias displays qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking with tunable Van Hove singularities (VHSs). Moreover, interactions pin the VHS to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping both at zero and finite bias depending on the stacking type, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. At half filling, we obtain the phase diagram as a function of interaction strength, interlayer bias, and twist angle. We find a competition driven by band mixing between an isotropic ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet that are nearly degenerate over a wide range of experimentally accessible parameters. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1T tTMDs can be strongly tuned in situ both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Classification of Magnetism and Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net magnetism protected by symmetry(s) other than parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) and a resulting spin-split band, has been studied exclusively in crystalline materials. Here, we extend the framework of AM to quasicrystals (QCs). We start from a comparison between the N\'{e}el state on the square lattice and that on a $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QC, with both belonging to the same $d$-wave irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_4$ point group. Consequently, while the former is antiferromagnetism (AFM) protected by the combined $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ and translational symmetry, the lack of translational symmetry in the latter breaks the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, and the additional mirror or rotation symmetry protects AM. This example suggests that AM is more common in QCs than in crystals and can be easily explored through a point-group symmetry-based classification. Therefore, we classify magnetic phases in 2D $D_n$-symmetric QCs without spin-orbit coupling, by using IRRPs of $D_n$. Consequently, the identity IRRP represents ferromagnetism, the inversion-odd 1D IRRPs for twice-of-odd $n$ represent AFM, and all the remaining 1D IRRPs represent AM, protected by either mirror or rotation symmetry. We further take the Hubbard model to verify this result in various QCs with different symmetries. Our work highlights the QC as a natural platform where AM is common among magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekul\'{e}-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solution and thermodynamic properties of graphene in the presence of minimal length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, where the electrons propagating inside are described by the ultra-relativistic Dirac equation normally reserved for very high energy massless particles. In this work, we show that graphene under a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$ symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well determined. We find that the Dulong-Petit law is verified and the heat capacity is independent of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation for the systems with inhomogeneous distribution of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the system with inhomogeneous distribution of macroscopic parameters we obtain thermodynamic relation which depends on the spatial point (coordinate). In our approach, to obtain such a relation we use the basic ideas of the method of nonequilibrium statistical operator combined with the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. First of all, we define the thermodynamic relation for the system with homogeneous distribution of particles. Possible behavior peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can be described in the same way. We consider the systems with attractive and repulsive interactions as well as self-gravitating systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond conventional half-metals: gapless states and spin gapless semiconducting behavior in X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) Heusler compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for high-performance spintronic materials motivates the exploration of Heusler alloys with unconventional electronic properties. Using density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$ eV), we investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states, which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: a practical recipe for four-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>
