      <title>Phase controlled multi-terminal Josephson junction in ternary hybrid nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents multiterminal Josephson junctions in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor InAsSb-Al nanocrosses. Hybrid nanocrosses are grown using molecular beam epitaxy and are formed through As-assisted merging of oppositely directed InAsSb nanowires. We explain this complex ternary merging mechanism using a temperature-dependent phase diagram and investigate the detailed crystal structure with atomic-resolution imaging. The hybrid nanoscrosses enabled the fabrication of multiterminal Josephson junction devices, which were characterized at low temperatures. The supercurrent through each terminal combination was measured as a function of the density in the junction and the relative phase of the terminals, which was controlled by an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Superexchanges and Charge Transfer in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Motivated by the recent experimental reports, we study an 11-band Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, by using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches. Our results demonstrate that the major antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ can be significantly weaker than in the bulk at 29.5 Gpa. The out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is significantly reduced by about 27% in film, whereas, the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unchanged. We estimate the antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\parallel}$ and $J_{\perp}$ by using perturbation theory. Regarding charge transfer, we find that biaxial compression in the thin films results in reduced charge-transfer gap compared to the bulk material. We determine the distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) orbitals and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals. A significant particle-hole asymmetry regarding carrier doping is revealed. Our results provide a foundation for subsequent studies of the low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, and ofer key insights into the understanding of physical differences between the film and bulk bilayer nickelate high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Twistraintronics in Square Moire Superlattices of Stacked Graphene Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures with geometries that were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics-induced breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator. By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of a Vortex Spin-Torque Oscillator in an MTJ with a Vortex Polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) are promising nanoscale microwave sources for spintronic applications, serving as signal generators or elements in neuromorphic computing systems. In this paper, we investigate the experimental realization of an oscillator based on a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) comprising two magnetic layers: a reference layer (RL) and a free layer (FL). We demonstrate that when magnetic vortices with opposite chirality and polarity are formed in the layers, the application of a current induces auto-oscillations even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect is observed in devices with diameters ranging from 800 to 1000 nm, exhibiting oscillation frequencies between 110 and 60 MHz. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the action of a spin current with vortex-like polarization injected from the RL, interacting with the magnetic vortex in the FL. This interaction generates a local out-of-plane effective field due to spin-transfer torque, which acts on the vortex core and initiates its motion. The observed mechanism differs qualitatively from the case of uniformly polarized spin currents perpendicular to the plane, where the resulting in-plane field acts on the planar components of the vortex magnetization.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced switching of magnetisation in the epsilon-near-zero regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of controlling spins using ultrashort light and strain pulses has triggered intense discussions about the mechanisms responsible for magnetic re-ordering. All-optical magnetisation switching can be achieved through ultrafast heat-driven demagnetisation or transient modifications of magnetic anisotropy. During the phononic switching of magnetic dielectrics, however, mid-infrared optical excitations can modify the crystal environment via both the thermal quenching of anisotropy and the generation of strain respectively, with the relative distinction between these thermal and non-thermal processes remaining an open question. Here, we examine the effect of mid-infrared pulses tuned to the frequency of optical phonon resonances on the labyrinthine domain structure of a cobalt-doped yttrium iron garnet film. We find that the labyrinthine domains are transformed into stable parallel stripes, and quantitative micromagnetic calculations demonstrate this stems predominantly from a partial quenching of the anisotropy. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, we find that this heat-facilitated process of magnetisation switching is spectrally strongest not at the maximum of absorbed optical energy but rather at the epsilon-near-zero points. Our results reveal that the epsilon-near-zero condition provides an alternative pathway for laser-driven control of magnetisation, even when the underlying mechanism is primarily thermal.</description>

      <title>Short-range Spin Freezing State in the Double Trillium Lattice Spin-Liquid Candidate KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ Revealed via $^{31}$P NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study, combined with thermodynamic measurements and first-principle band-structure calculations, has been conducted to explore the ground state of the $S = 5/2$ double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$. Our experimental results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)]. Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below $T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics. Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of the Magnetic Monopole Field in a 3D Artificial Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, long hypothesised as fundamental particles carrying isolated magnetic charge, emerge in spin-ice systems as fractionalised excitations governed by the ice rule. Yet their three-dimensional field structure has never been directly visualised. Here, we use two-photon lithography and processing to fabricate a fully three-dimensional artificial spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry. We then use scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. We find that ice-rule vertices produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilised by the local frustrated two-in/two out ordering principle. Direct imaging of the monopole stray field shows a highly divergent profile. By correlating experiment with micromagnetic simulations and performing a multipole expansion of the reconstructed magnetisation, we reveal that monopoles in 3DASI are non-trivial micromagnetic entities, carrying both magnetic charge and an intrinsic moment, giving rise to anisotropic interactions that are dependent upon the quasiparticles position on the lattice. Results suggest that as monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, revealing that monopole coupling is tunable through geometry, being set by the local vertex topology. These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic metamaterial in which nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of emergent magnetic charges.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Field induced Quantized Longitudinal Conductivity in Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an in plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer magnetic topological insulators, characterized by a quantized longitudinal conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields. This state emerges at a quantum critical point separating quantum anomalous Hall phases tuned by field angle and orientation, directly linking gap-closing behavior to quantized criticality. Temperature and gate dependent transport measurements, supported by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics with universal conductivity, offering both microscopic insight into critical transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing quantum criticality in topological systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Valent Ce Disrupts Magnetic Ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed valency in intermetallics with lanthanide cations is well established as a pathway to unusual charge transport, complex magnetism, and superconductivity. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties of the mixed valent compound CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterize CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ as a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) compound with mixed-valent Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ on a single crystallographic site. $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy indicates that the Fe sublattice is nonmagnetic, in direct contrast with recent reports of this compound. Low-temperature electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements show no evidence of magnetic ordering, and a modest Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma$) of 22.7 mJ/mol$\cdot$K$^2$ make extensive Kondo hybridization unlikely. DC and AC magnetic susceptibility data suggest short-range magnetic order at $\sim$5.2 and 7.6 K with no frequency dependence, ruling out canonical spin-glass behavior in this compound. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility data does not contain any broad features that are typically associated with an intermediate valence state in Ce, suggesting either high-temperature valence fluctuation or a different mechanism of mixed valency. This work demonstrates that mixed-valent Ce inhibits magnetic ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ and provides a broader picture for how to analyze short-range spin interactions in Q1D intermetallics.</description>

      <title>Preparation and evaluation of alexandrite, forsterite, and topaz substrates for the epitaxial growth of rutile oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-insulator transitions and superconductivity in rutile-structured oxides hold promise for advanced electronic applications, yet their thin film synthesis is severely hindered by limited substrate options. Here, we present three single- crystalline substrates, BeAl2O4, Mg2SiO4, and Al2SiO4(F,OH)2, prepared via optimized thermal and chemical treatments to achieve atomically smooth surfaces suitable for epitaxial growth. Atomic force microscopy confirms atomic step-and-terrace surface morphologies, and oxide molecular-beam epitaxy growth on these substrates demonstrates successful heteroepitaxy of rutile TiO2, VO2, NbO2, and RuO2 films. Among these unconventional substrates, BeAl2O4 exhibits exceptional thermal and chemical stability, making it a versatile substrate candidate. These findings introduce new substrate platforms that facilitate strain engineering and exploration of rutile oxide thin films, potentially advancing the study of their strain-dependent physical properties.</description>

      <title>Review of the tight-binding method applicable to the properties of moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring a wide range of ex- otic quantum phenomena. Unlike angstrom-scale materials, the moir\'e length-scale system contains a large number of atoms, and its electronic structure is significantly modulated by the lattice relaxation. These features pose a huge theoretical challenge. Among the available theoretical approaches, tight-binding (TB) methods are widely employed to predict the electronic, transport, and optical properties of systems such as twisted graphene, twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and related moir\'e materials. In this review, we pro- vide a comprehensive overview of atomistic TB Hamiltonians and the numerical techniques commonly used to model graphene-based, TMD-based and hBN-based moir\'e superlattices. We also discuss the connection between atomistic TB descriptions and effective low-energy continuum models. Two examples of different moir\'e materials and geometries are provided to emphasize the advantages of the TB methods. This review is intended to serve as a theoretical and practical guide for those seeking to apply TB methods to the study of various properties of moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Many-body wave function and edge magnetization of an open $p+is$ superconducting chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although BCS wave function for superconductors under periodic boundary conditions are well-established, obtaining an explicit form of the many-body BCS wave function under open boundary condition is usually a nontrivial problem. In this work, we construct the exact BCS ground state wave function of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 superconductor with $p+ is$ pairing symmetry under open boundary conditions for special sets of parameters. The spin magnetization on the edges are calculated explicitly using the obtained wave function. Approximate expression of the wave function is also discussed based on degenerate perturbation theory when the $s$-wave component is much smaller than the $p$-wave one, which provides more intuitive understanding for the system. Our work is useful for obtaining deeper understandings of open $p+ is$ superconducting chains on a wave function level.</description>

      <title>Disorder-broadened topological Hall phase and anomalous Hall scaling in FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that are promising candidates for low-power spintronic memory and logic devices. Realizing skyrmion-based devices requires an understanding of how structural disorder affects their stability and transport properties. This study uses Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$ to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall signal from a narrow window near 200\~K in pristine films down to 4\~K at the highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Terahertz Photoconductivity and Near-Field Imaging of Nanoscale Inhomogeneities in Multilayer Epitaxial Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs) further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime. The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c &gt;$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced electron-electron and electron- phonon scattering and to an interaction of electrons with mid-gap states.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of linear magnetoresistance in Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the quantized energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum, the energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR. Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.</description>

      <title>Coupled dimerized alternating-bond quantum spin chains in the distorted honeycomb-lattice magnet Cu$_5$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound.</description>

      <title>Ultimate photon entanglement in biexciton cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Compact localized fermions and Ising anyons in a chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms. We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS) emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Unexpected increase of intensity-dependent excitonic second- and third-harmonic generation induced by static electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute and analyze the dependence of excitonic second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) as a function of the optical excitation intensity in the presence of static electric fields by solving the semiconductor Bloch equations. Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound intralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane electric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s K-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of the static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently intense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases superlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton ionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that these dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including static and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark localization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference between optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration. Our findings offer several new possibilities for controlling the strong-field dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity in two dimensions: intertwined symmetries and singlet-triplet mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity for the case of two-dimensional square- and triangular-lattice systems. Our approach is based on an effective single particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin Precession and Spin Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of the interplay of charge order and unconventional pairings in the 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide here a study of some competing ordering tendencies exhibited by the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice. To this end, we investigate the interplay between superconductivity, charge-density wave (CDW) and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain. As a result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW. These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the properties of realistic strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial stress tuning of the anomalous Hall effect in Mn3Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable electronic properties in magnetic materials lead to novel physical phenomena that have the potential to be exploited in the design of new spintronic devices. Here, we report the effect of uniaxial stress on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the hexagonal frustrated antiferromagnetic Heusler compound Mn3Ge. Our x-ray diffraction results show that the c/a ratio varies linearly with strain when stress is applied along the a axis, as well as a significantly higher Young's modulus along the c direction. The linear behavior of the c/a ratio under uniaxial stress mirrors that seen under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa, but results in a characteristically different behavior of the AHE. Stress applied along the a axis induces a distortion in the ab plane, smoothing the abrupt jump in the AHE signal at zero magnetic field. In contrast, stress applied along the c axis has little effect, presumably due to the higher Young's modulus. We argue that this is due to pronounced changes in magnetic order.</description>

      <title>The action of the nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion on the homogeneity in the high concentration domain for itinerant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact results are presented for itinerant systems
  demonstrating that the nearest neighbor Coulomb
  repulsion (V) destroys the homogeneity in the high concentration regime, this
  property being not present in the low concentration domain. Since the effects
  of V often seems contradictory, and the number of phases in which it could
  appear is extremely large, this result underlines that the action of the
  nearest neighbor repulsion is not necessarily routed in the characteristics
  of phases on which it acts, but could be intimately related to V itself.
  The $V &gt; 0$ case usually means non-integrability, hence the deduced exact
  ground states are related to non-integrable systems, the technique being
  based on positive semidefinite operator properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the absorption of light in a bulk homogeneous semiconductor produces photocarriers with non-zero momentum, it generally does not produce a current in the absence of an applied electric field because equal amounts of carriers with opposite momentum are injected. The interference of absorption processes, for example, between one-photon and two-photon absorption, can produce a current because constructive interference for carriers with one momentum can correspond to destructive interference for carriers with the opposite momentum. We show that for the interference between two-photon and three-photon absorption, the current has a narrower angular spread, i.e., a ``beam'' of electrons in a specified direction is produced in the semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Influence of Bi Alloying on GaAs Valence Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi alloying is predicted to transform GaAs from a semiconductor to a topological insulator or semi-metal. To date, studies of the GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ alloy band structure have been limited, and the origins of Bi-induced enhancement of the spin-orbit splitting energy, $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$, are unresolved. Here, we present high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of droplet-free epitaxial GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ films with $x_{\mathrm{Bi}}$ = 0.06. In addition to quantifying the Bi-induced shifts of the light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands, we probe the origins of the Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$. Using exact-two-component density functional theory calculations, we identify the key role of Bi p-orbitals in the upward shift of the light-hole and heavy-hole bands that results in the Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$.</description>

      <title>Engineering Anderson Localization in Arbitrary Dimensions with Interacting Quasiperiodic Kicked Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of interactions and quasiperiodic driving in the Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons subjected to a sequence of delta kicks. Building on the known mapping between the kicked rotor and the Anderson model, we show that both interparticle interactions and quasiperiodic modulations of the kicking strength can independently and simultaneously generate synthetic dimensions. In the absence of modulation, interactions between two bosons already promote an effective two-dimensional Anderson model. Introducing one or two additional incommensurate frequencies further extends the system to three and four effective dimensions, respectively. Through extensive numerical simulations of the two-body dynamics and finite-time scaling analysis, we observe Anderson localization and the associated critical behavior characteristic of the orthogonal universality class. This combined use of interactions and quasiperiodic driving thus provides a versatile framework for emulating Anderson localization and its transition in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Methods for Quantum Matter: Strongly correlated Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for applying on-shell scattering amplitude methods to emergent relativistic phases of quantum matter. Many strongly correlated systems, from Dirac and Weyl semimetals to topological-insulator surfaces, exhibit low-energy excitations that are effectively massless relativistic spinors. We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Structural modulation, physical properties, and electronic band structure of the kagome metal UCr$_6$Ge$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet, 5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$ members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic ground state across the material family.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Uncertainty-Governed Spin Dynamics in s-d Coupled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum fluctuation effects arising from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle governing angular momentum operators in the full dynamical evolution of disentanglement-entanglement-disentanglement between itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments under the s-d exchange interaction. Beyond the conventional deterministic spin-transfer torque, we identify an intrinsic channel for the transfer of spin quantum fluctuations. By extending the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include both quantum and thermal stochastic fields, we reveal a temperature regime where quantum fluctuations dominate spin dynamics. Furthermore, voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy can exponentially amplify these quantum fluctuation signals, enabling their binary detection via tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions. These results establish a microscopic framework for quantum fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and provide a fundamental route toward spin-based quantum true random number generation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nodal Gap in a Doped Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level, accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2 AFM Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Point Defects Limited Carrier Mobility in Janus MoSSe monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects, often formed during the growth of Janus MoSSe, act as built-in scatterers and affect carrier transport in electronic devices based on Janus MoSSe. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the impact of common defects, such as sulfur vacancies, selenium vacancies, and chalcogen substitutions, on electron transport, and compare their influence with that of mobility limited by phonons. Here, we define the saturation defect concentration ($C_{\mathrm{sat}}$) as the highest defect density that still allows the total mobility to remain within 90\% of the phonon-limited value, providing a direct measure of how many defects a device can tolerate. Based on $C_{\mathrm{sat}}$, we find a clear ranking of defect impact: selenium substituting for sulfur is relatively tolerant, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx2.07\times10^{-4}$, while selenium vacancies are the most sensitive, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx3.65\times10^{-5}$. Our $C_{\mathrm{sat}}$ benchmarks and defect hierarchy provide quantitative, materials-specific design rules that can guide the fabrication of high-mobility field-effect transistors, electronic devices, and sensors based on Janus MoSSe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.</description>

      <title>From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating functions for quantum metric, Berry curvature, and quantum Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate that the fidelity between two density matrices is a generating function, through which the quantum Fisher information matrix and Christoffel symbol of the first kind in the parameter space can be obtained through derivatives with respect to the parameters. For pure states, the fidelity and phase of the product between two quantum states are shown to be the generating functions of the quantum metric and Berry curvature, respectively. Further limiting to systems described by real wave functions, our formalism recovers the well-known result that the fidelity between two probability mass functions is the generating function of the classical Fisher information matrix, indicating a hierarchy of quantum to information geometry. The Bloch representation of the generating functions is given explicitly for $2\times 2$ density matrices, and the application to canonical ensemble of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model suggests the mitigation of quantum geometry at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Markovian Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian nonreciprocal quantum lattices.</description>

      <title>Mapping the positions of Two-Level-Systems on the surface of a superconducting transmon qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherence of superconducting quantum computers is severely limited by material defects that create parasitic two-level-systems (TLS). Progress is complicated by lacking understanding how TLS are created and in which parts of a qubit circuit they are most detrimental. Here, we present a method to determine the individual positions of TLS at the surface of a transmon qubit. We employ a set of on-chip gate electrodes near the qubit to generate local DC electric fields that are used to tune the TLS' resonance frequencies. The TLS position is inferred from the strengths at which TLS couple to different electrodes and comparing them to electric field simulations. We found that the majority of detectable surface-TLS was residing on the leads of the qubit's Josephson junction, despite the dominant contribution of its coplanar capacitor to electric field energy and surface area. This indicates that the TLS density is significantly enhanced near shadow-evaporated electrodes fabricated by lift-off techniques. Our method is useful to identify critical circuit regions where TLS contribute most to decoherence, and can guide improvements in qubit design and fabrication methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. Some possible mechanisms for the observed resistance modifications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we numerically show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. This claim is further supported by analytical effective-medium theory and by numerical estimates of scattering mean-free paths. Finally, we introduce ``polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Mott Gap Softening Coinciding with Spin Correlations Collapse in a-RuCl3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.</description>

Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of many-body electronic correlation entropy from local measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum correlations in many-body systems is instrumental to understanding the nature of emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The correlation entropy serves as a key metric for assessing the complexity of a quantum many-body state in interacting electronic systems. However, its determination requires the measurement of all single-particle correlators across a macroscopic sample, which can be impractical. Machine learning methods have been shown to allow learning the correlation entropy from a reduced set of measurements, yet these methods assume that the targeted system is contained in the set of training Hamiltonians. Here we show that a transfer learning strategy enables correlation entropy learning from a reduced set of measurements in families of Hamiltonians never considered in the training set. We demonstrate this transfer learning methodology in a wide variety of interacting models including local and non-local attractive and repulsive many-body interactions, long-range hopping, doping, magnetic field, and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we show how this transfer learning methodology allows detecting quantum many-body phases never observed during their training set without prior knowledge about them. Our results demonstrate that correlation entropy learning can be potentially performed experimentally without requiring training in the experimentally realized Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction chirality reversal with ferromagnetic thickness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultrathin ferromagnetic films sandwiched between two distinct heavy metal layers or between a heavy metal and an oxide layer, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is of interfacial origin. Its chirality and strength are determined by the properties of the adjacent heavy metals and the degree of oxidation at the interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the DMI chirality can change solely with variations in the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer - an effect that has not been experimentally studied in details or explained until now. Our experimental observation in the trilayer system Ta/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal that variations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at the interface, driven by the structural relaxations in the ultrathin regime, lead to an inversion of DMI chirality. We hence propose a new degree of freedom to tune DMI chirality and the associated chiral spin textures by tailoring crystal structure e.g. using strain or surface acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</description>

      <title>Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals</title>

Abstract: This article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic, and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but are symmetric in respect of the product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermagnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of a crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets, there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas, in altermagnets, we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spin-blockade leakage current in a Ge hole double quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group IV quantum dot hole spin systems, exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling, provide platforms for various qubit architectures. The rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in the Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. We identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Compensation between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on regular hyperbolic trivalent tilings. Depending on the length $p$ of the elementary polygons, we examine two distinct tri-colorings of the tiling. Using a recent conjecture on the ground-state flux sector, we compute the phase diagram via exact diagonalizations and derive analytical expressions for the effective Hamiltonians in the isolated-dimer limit which are valid for all values of $p$. Our results interpolate between the Euclidean honeycomb lattice and the trivalent Bethe lattice ($p=\infty$) for which we derive the exact solution of the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Controlled Chirality Switching of Weyl Quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</description>

Abstract: Light emissive nanostructures were prepared from boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) filled with inorganic lead halide perovskites. BNNTs provide a platform for facile synthesis of high aspect ratio perovskite quantum wires having color-tunable, highly polarized emission. BNNTs form a flexible and robust protective shell around individual nanowires, that mitigate degradation during post-processing for practical applications, while allowing to exploit the emission of the perovskite nanowires due to its optical transparency. The wire diameter can be tuned by choosing appropriate BNNT hosts, giving easy access to the strongly quantum confined diameter range. The individual encapsulated quantum wires can be used as building blocks for nanoscale photonic devices, and to create large-scale flexible assemblies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal hopping may display the non-Hermitian skin effect, where states under open boundary conditions localize exponentially at one edge of the system. This localization has been linked to spectral winding and topological gain, forming a bulk-boundary correspondence akin to the one relating edge modes to bulk topological invariants in topological insulators and superconductors. In this work, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered Hatano-Nelson models. We relate the localization of states to spectral winding using the Lyapunov exponent and the Thouless formula. We identify two kinds of phase transitions and relate them to transport properties. Our framework is relevant to a broad class of 1D non-Hermitian models, opening new directions for disorder-resilient transport and quantum-enhanced sensing in photonic, optomechanical, and superconducting platforms.</description>

Abstract: Recent researches on tilted Dirac cone materials have unveiled an astonishing property, the metric of the spacetime can be altered in these materials by applying a perpendicular electric field. This phenomenon is observed near the Fermi velocity, which is significantly lower than the speed of light. According to this property, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau action from the microscopic Hamiltonian of the BCS theory for the tilted Dirac cone materials. This derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nanocalorimetric technique based on microsecond-pulsed heating (\mu s-PHnC) that enables high-sensitivity, quasi-isothermal heat capacity measurements on nanoscale samples. Such resolution is critical for exploring thermodynamic signatures in low-dimensional materials, where conventional techniques fall short. By confining thermal excitation to microsecond timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \mu m^{2}. The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies. This advancement establishes a robust and scalable platform for probing thermal phenomena in nanostructured and low-dimensional materials, significantly broadening the scope of nanocalorimetry.</description>

      <title>Flat quasicrystalline tilings in terms of density wave approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Landau theory considers structural phase transitions and crystallization as a condensation of several critical density waves whose wave vectors are symmetrically equivalent. Analyzing the simplest nonequilibrium Landau potentials obtained for decagonal and dodecagonal cases, we derive constraints on the phases of the critical waves and deduce two pairs of flat tilings that are the simplest from the viewpoint of our theory. Each pair corresponds to the same irreducible interference pattern: the vertices of the first and second tilings are located at its minima and maxima, respectively. The first decagonal pair consists of the Penrose P1 tiling and the Tie and Navette one. The second pair is represented by dodecagonal tiling of squares, triangles, and shields, and previously unidentified one formed by regular dodecagons and identical deformed pentagons. Surprisingly, the proposed method for finding extrema of interference patterns provides a straightforward way to generate the Penrose tiling P3 and its more complicated analogues with 2n-fold symmetries. Within Landau theory, we discuss the assembly of the square-triangular tiling and its relationship with the dodecagonal tiling that includes shields. Then we develop a nonequilibrium assembly approach that is based on Landau theory and allows us to produce tilings with random phason strain characteristic of quasicrystals. Interestingly, the approach can generate tilings without or with a minimum number of defective tiles. Examples of real systems rationalized within Landau theory are considered as well. Finally, the derivation of other tilings arising from the reducible interference patterns is discussed, and the relative complexity of non-phenomenological interactions required for the assembly of decagonal and dodecagonal structures is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the delicate "hidden" interface conditions in WS2 flakes by advanced atomic force microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delicate interfacial conditions and behaviors play critical roles in determining the valuable physical properties of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures on substrates. However, directly probing these complex interface conditions remains challenging. Here, we reveal the coupled in-plane strain and out-of-plane bonding conditions in strain-engineered WS2 flakes by combining dual-harmonic electrostatic force microscopy (DH-EFM) and scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM). A striking contradiction is observed between the compressive-strain-induced larger bandgap (lower electrical conductivity) detected by DH-EFM, and the enhanced conductivity probed by sMIM. Comparative measurements under different sMIM modes demonstrate that this contradiction originates from a tip-loading-force-induced dynamic puckering effect, which is governed by the interfacial bonding strength. Furthermore, the progressive accumulation and subsequent release of conductivity during forward/backward sMIM-contact scans further confirms this dynamic puckering behavior, revealing pronounced differences in interface conditions between the open- and closed-ring regions of WS2.

      <title>Parastatistics revealed: Peierls phase twists and shifted conformal towers in interacting periodic chains</title>

Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin Coating: Homogeneous All-Inorganic Perovskite Films via High-Pressure Recrystallization</title>

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinite layer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in correlated topological metals</title>

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations. Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$ compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.</description>

Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE), characterized by nonreciprocal critical currents, represents a promising building block for future dissipationless electronics and quantum circuits. Realizing SDE requires breaking both time-reversal and inversion symmetry in the device. Here we use conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography to pattern reconfigurable superconducting weak links (WLs) at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) interface. By deliberately engineering the WL geometry at the nanoscale, we realize SDE in these devices in the presence of modest out-of-plane magnetic fields. The SDE polarity can be reversed by simply changing the WL position, and the rectification efficiency reaches up to 13% under optimal magnetic field conditions. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations reveal that the observed SDE originates from asymmetric vortex motion in the inversion-symmetry-breaking device geometry. This demonstration of SDE in the LAO/KTO system establishes a versatile platform for investigating and engineering vortex dynamics, forming the basis for engineered quantum circuit elements.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called $R$-parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model and is post-selection free when an overcrossing and an undercrossing coincide. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by SWAP gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect originating from worldline braiding dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.</description>

Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of a quasiparticle band structure with the quantum-selected configuration interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.</description>
