      <title>Nematic and partially polarized phases in rhombohedral graphene with varying number of layers: An extensive Hartree-Fock Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene systems with different number of layers feature an abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of the correlated phases for varying number of layers could be useful to interpret the experimental observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree-Fock calculations have been performed to build the phase diagram of rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene for different number of layers, in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can present nematicity, stabilized by electron-electron interactions, exhibiting rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping, and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin-orbit coupling proximity effects has been studied. Our results offer new insights into the role of correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems which will motivate future experimental and theoretical works.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary transition at the edge of a correlated topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with zig-zag edges and the Hubbard U-term tuned to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the two phases giving potential experimental signatures.</description>

      <title>Band mixing effects in one-dimensional charge transfer insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are governed by the electrons occupying strongly correlated $d$-orbitals that are hybridized with surrounding ligand oxygen $p$ orbitals to varying degrees. Their physics is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal (TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$, and on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a function of $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results spanning from the Mott insulating ($\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &gt; U$) to negative charge transfer regime $\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &lt; 0$ to better understand the ground and momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interfacial Quantum Dipoles in Charge Transfer Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteretic gate responses of two-dimensional material heterostructures serve as sensitive probes of the underlying electronic states and hold significant promise for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices. Here we identify a new mechanism of hysteretic behavior in graphene/$h$BN/$\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ charge transfer field effect devices. The hysteresis loop exhibits a sharp onset under low temperatures and evolves symmetrically relative to the charge transfer equilibrium. Unlike conventional flash memory devices, the charge transfer heterostructure features a transparent tunneling barrier and its hysteretic gate response is induced by the dynamic tuning of interfacial dipoles originating from quantum exchange interactions. The system acts effectively as a ferroelectric and gives rise to remarkable tunability of the hysteretic gate response under external electrical bias. Our work unveils a novel mechanism for engineering hysteretic behaviors via dynamic interfacial quantum dipoles.</description>

      <title>Mixed spin states for robust ferromagnetism in strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration, distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Opto- and magneto-tunable exceptional degeneracies in non-Hermitian ferromagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional $p$-wave magnets (UPMs) with odd-parity spin textures have attracted interest for their zero net magnetization and anisotropic spin-split Fermi surfaces. Here, we explore a non-Hermitian open quantum system composed of a ferromagnet and a UPM, subjected to an external magnetic field and off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL), serving as tunable control parameters. We demonstrate the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the proposed junction, whose locations can be modulated by the intrinsic properties of the UPM. These EPs exhibit different multiplicities and formation conditions compared to those in even-parity magnets (dubbed $d$- wave altermagnets), a distinction attributable to the preserved time-reversal and broken inversion symmetries characteristic of UPMs. We find that both the unidirectional magnetic field (with adjustable strength and orientation) and the CPL induce momentum-direction-dependent modifications to the EPs, such as their shifting, tilting, merging, or annihilation, supported by analyses of spin projection and eigenvector overlap. Although both perturbations influence the EP structure, they operate via distinct mechanisms: CPL induces a global Floquet re-normalization, enabling dynamic tunability through light, whereas the unidirectional magnetic field selectively alters orientation-aligned terms, lacking such tunability. Beyond revealing EP dynamics in UPM-based junctions, our results highlight UPMs as promising platforms for non-Hermitian phenomena in future spintronics.</description>

      <title>Unified description of cuprate superconductors by fractionalized electrons emerging from integrated analyses of photoemission spectra and quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Transport in Single Quantum Dots: A Review from Linear Response to Nonlinear Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals: A Hyperspatial Projective Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected, momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments, has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that interaction-induced N\'eel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and $h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting, which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant Fields Inducing Energy Towers in Lieb Quantum Spin Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg model on a Lieb lattice. A set of exact eigenstates is constructed based on the restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) when a resonant staggered magnetic field is applied. These states are identical to the eigenstates of a system of two coupled angular momenta. Furthermore, we find that the RSGA can be applied to other eigenstates of the Lieb lattice in an approximate manner. Numerical simulations reveal that there exist sets of eigenstates, which obey a quasi-RSGA. These states act as energy towers within the low-lying excited spectrum, indicating that they are quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Using surface plasmons to detect spin inertia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that spin dynamics may acquire an inertial effect in a few metallic magnets, deviating from the traditional inertia-free dynamics. It remains an open question to ascertain the physical mechanisms and universality of the spin inertia across diverse magnetic systems. Here, we show that spin inertia generates nutation spin waves in the terahertz regime, which can hybridize with the surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) conducting materials such as graphene. By exciting hybrid spin wave-plasmon modes and analyzing the reflection spectrum of a 2D material$|$magnet heterostructure, we propose a method to quantitatively determine the strength of spin inertia in magnetic layers. Our approach is universally applicable to all types of magnetic insulators and could advance the future exploration of the magnitude and physical mechanism of spin inertia.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model in the canonical ensemble: a beyond mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without external trapping potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Focused Ion Beam patterning of MnSb(1-101) based spintronic devcies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low temperature transport measurements are presented of ferromagnetic MnSb devices with the magnetic properties patterned using a Ga focused ion beam FIB system at 30 keV. FIB patterning introduces disorder and this is quantified in this paper through measurements of the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity. The MnSb structural phase is the niccolite phase with a surface state in addition to bulk states. FIB doses up to 1E16 Ga ions per square cm reduces the anisotropic magnetoresistance signal but increases the size of the anomalous Hall effect signal in out of plane magnetic fields, B. The anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity is e squared divided by h in the undamaged devices, where e is the electronic charge and h is Plancks constant. This quantity is sensitive to the level of disorder induced by the Ga ion beam, reducing to zero at dose levels greater than 1E16 Ga ions per square cm. The resistivity shows a logarithmic B dependence after the magnetization has saturated with the low field anisotropic magnetoresistance contribution of 0.12 percent. The conductivity change is e squared divided by h in the magnetic field range of logarithmic B behavior. The resistivity shows a reduced fit to a logarithmic B dependence at high FIB dose levels and is dependent on the damage uniformity. Patterning nanostructured magnetic behavior in MnSb, with compatibility to altermagnetic materials, in particular the niccolite phase of CrSb and non trivial Berry phase contributions to transport make this ferromagnetic material and patterning technique useful for future spintronic device development.</description>

      <title>Exploring Weak Turbulence of Phonon and Magnon Beams in Magneto-Acoustic Ultrathin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a simple theoretical model describing narrow envelope surface acoustic waves
  (phonons) and spin waves (magnons) in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Based on the general
  principles of weak wave turbulence, the model considers interactions between beams of an ideal
  phonon gas and a weakly non-ideal magnon gas, which represent magnetoacoustic oscillations in
  the system. Equations for the wave envelopes of phonons and magnons, along with their harmonics,
  are derived, incorporating nonlinear effects from three- and four-particle interactions. In
  the general non-resonant case, linear stationary envelope simulations are sufficient. These clarify
  the experimentally observed angular dependence of the transmitted acoustic signal with respect
  to the orientation of the magnetic field. The study highlights increased energy losses associated
  with enhanced magnetoacoustic coupling. Given the broad interdisciplinary interest in weak turbulence
  phenomena within condensed matter physics and nonlinear wave dynamics, our model
  offers significant predictive capabilities and greatly simplifies calculations of quasiparticle beam
  interactions.</description>

      <title>Orbital Inverse Faraday and Cotton-Mouton Effects in Hall Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall (QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH fluid.</description>

      <title>From trigonal to triclinic: Symmetry-tuned Rashba effects in buckled honeycomb SrHfO$_{3}$-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb (SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R = 29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</description>

      <title>A Clarification on Quantum-Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder effects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.</description>

      <title>Inertial Imaging of Dual Mass Distributions on a Graphene Nanodrum: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the possibility for inertial imaging of spatially patterned annular mass distributions of a circular graphene nanodrum resonator. By placing two distinct analytes in concentric annular regions, we harness the vibrational mode-specific sensitivities of the nanodrum to estimate their respective mass densities. An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz principle is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts. Finite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the shifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying geometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency shifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass distributions of annular rings. The results indicate that the estimation errors are lower for analytes placed near the antinodal regions of the dominant vibration mode, with the lowest error being 1.82 % for analyte A and 2.03 % for analyte B. Furthermore, thinner annular rings demonstrate enhanced detection accuracy due to reduced modal overlap. This study demonstrates an analytical strategy for mass detection using a graphene nanodrum by providing insights into optimal analyte placement and structural design for high-precision multi-target mass sensing applications.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Ground State of Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$: The Crucial Role of Frustrated Zigzag Chains Revealed by Inelastic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on the magnetically frustrated $S=\frac12$ sawtooth-chain compound atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ featuring inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. Transverse to the sawtooth chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75 meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize atacamite's low-energy magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and control of spin currents are crucial for advancing next-generation spintronic technologies. These technologies depend on materials capable of efficiently sourcing and interconverting spin and charge currents, while overcoming some limitations associated with conventional ferromagnets and heavy metals. Kagome topological antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals, such as Mn$_3$Sn, present unique advantages owing to their distinct magnetic order and significant Berry curvature-driven transport phenomena. In this study, we systematically investigate spin current generation and spin-to-charge conversion phenomena in epitaxial (0001)-oriented Mn$_3$Sn thin films. Our findings reveal a spin Hall angle of 0.9$\%$ and a nearly isotropic in-plane spin Hall conductivity of 44.4~($\hbar$/e) $\Omega^{-1}$.cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature, originating from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as discussed in light of first-principle calculations. Furthermore, in Mn$_3$Sn(0001)/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ heterostructures, we observe a high spin-mixing conductance of 28.52 nm$^{-2}$ and an interfacial spin-transparency of approximately 72$\%$. Notably, we also find that the spin diffusion length in Mn$_3$Sn(0001) epitaxial films exceeds 15 nm at room temperature. Our results highlight the potential of the topological Weyl noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn as an efficient material for spin transport and conversion in prospective spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ergodicity of Worldvolume HMC via embedding Generalized-thimble HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times 6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).</description>

      <title>Simulating high-temperature superconductivity in moir\'e WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moir\'e WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform for tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moir\'e WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moir\'e unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1, superconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc occurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective Fermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices that can be used to study high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.</description>

      <title>Flat bands, Dirac cones, and higher-order band crossings in twisted multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase Dynamics of Sliding Electron Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a non-vanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system's nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized. As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

      <title>Gate-voltage-driven quantum phase transition at $0.7 (2e^2/h)$ in quantum point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum phase transition (QPT) in quantum point contacts by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent quasiparticle energy at the Fermi level at zero temperature. This energy is computed using the local density of states at the site of the localized spin, which is extracted from the replicated gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance shaped by entangled-state tunneling. The QPT occurs between symmetric ($G \geq 0.7 G_0$) and asymmetric ($G &lt; 0.7 G_0$) Kondo coupling states, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, and is driven by the migration of a localized spin in response to the side-gate voltage. The asymmetric state exhibits two distinct Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The existence of two Kondo temperatures in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ regime accounts for both the anomalous gate-voltage dependence of the zero-bias anomaly width and the inability to define a Kondo temperature in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ region.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic layer polarization and multi-flatband transport in non-centrosymmetric mixed-stacked multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.</description>

      <title>Bath parameterization in multi-band cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable algorithms to solve complex impurity problems are instrumental to a routine use of quantum embedding methods for material discovery. In this context, we employ an efficient selected configuration interaction impurity solver to investigate the role of bath discretization, specifically, bath size and parameterization, in Hamiltonian-based cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for the one- and two-orbital Hubbard models. We consider two- and four-site clusters for the single-orbital model and a two-site cluster for the two-orbital model. Our results demonstrate that, for small bath sizes, the choice of parameterization can significantly influence the solution, highlighting the importance of systematic convergence checks. Comparing different bath parameterizations not only reveals the robustness of a given solution but can also provide insights into the nature of different solutions and potential instabilities of the paramagnetic state. We present an extensive analysis of the zero-temperature Mott transition of the paramagnetic half-filled single-band Hubbard model, benchmarking our findings against previous literature. We find that for the single-band model the dependence on parameterization is weak for the largest bath sizes accessible with ASCI, while a tendency towards a nematic solution can be seen when the bath size is small. Building on this, we extend our study to the multi-band regime, where we present the first systematic analysis at zero temperature for two orbitals and a two-site cluster. This setup allows us to assess the effect of nearest-neighbor dynamical correlations on the multi-orbital Mott transition. In this case, some quantitative dependence on the parameterization is retained for the two-orbital model, for instance in the value of the critical interaction for a Mott transition.</description>

Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials are a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr- and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors</title>

Abstract: Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moir\'e materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</description>

      <title>Strain-Controlled Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Number Reversal in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>
