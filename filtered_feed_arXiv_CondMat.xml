      <title>Dynamics of excitons in CdSe nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to calculate the linear and nonlinear optical functions of CdSe nanoplatelets, taking into account the effect of a dielectric confinement on excitonic states. We consider both stationary and non-stationary excitation regime. We obtain obtain analytical expressions for the absorption coefficient, the exciton resonance energy and binding energy of nanoplatelets. The impact of plate geometry (thickness, lateral dimension) on the spectrum is discussed. In the nonlinear case we analyze the impact of temperature. For the short-pulse excitation the time dependence of the spectra is considered. The results are compared with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cu2O Rydberg Excitons -- Kerr Effect and Quantum Beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear refraction and the nonlinear Kerr phase shift which are due to Rydberg excitons induced in Cu2O crystal by short-time pulses. We observe the phenomenon of quantum beats, analogous to that observed in exciton emission spectra, obtained in the same conditions. The calculated temporal evolution show dependence on the exciton state number, the applied laser power, and quantities related to dissipative processes.</description>

      <title>A model for positron annihilation in multi-layer systems by solving the diffusion equation using different positron affinities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for solving the positron diffusion equation in multi-layer systems. Our approach incorporates material-specific implantation profiles, diffusion parameters, and positron affinities. It utilizes a Markov chain approach to model annihilation probabilities and provides fitting capabilities for experimental S (lineshape) parameter data. We have implemented this algorithm in Python and made it available for free under the name LIMPID. To demonstrate its performance, we analyze depth-resolved Doppler-Broadening Spectroscopy measurements of a Cu layer on a Si substrate, achieving excellent agreement with the experimental profiles. The LIMPID tool enhances the reproducibility and comparability of positron defect characterization measurements across different research groups.</description>

      <title>Structure and interactions of atoms and diatomic molecules: from ultracold gases to doped solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature entropies and possible states in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$, $FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Depth-resolved low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) was used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ value are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, indicating that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of experimental and theoretical studies of the spin response of charge carriers to an external magnetic field in bulk semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures. The linear response is quantitatively characterized by the magnitude of the electron or hole g factor. Various experimental methods for measuring the electron g factor are considered, beginning with historical works and including modern research. A detailed analysis of theoretical methods for calculating the electron and hole g factors in bulk semiconductors and nanostructures of various shapes also includes fundamental work from previous years and the present time.</description>

      <title>The theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions with equal Fermi velocities and effective masses in all layers. The theory takes into account phase gradients in superconducting layers commonly ignored in the past. At $T=0$ the current-phase relation was derived for any thickness $L$ of the normal layer in the model of the steplike pairing potential model analytically. The obtained current-phase relation is essentially different from that in theory neglecting phase gradients, especially in the limit $L\to 0$ (short junction). The analysis resolves the problem with the charge conservation law in the steplike pairing potential model. The current-phase relation at temperatures exceeding the energy spacing between Andreev levels but less than the critical temperature was also calculated numerically. The current at these temperatures is temperature independent and decreases with growing $L$ as $1/L^4$. The previous theory predicted the current exponentially decreasing with growing $T$ and $L$. Possible implications of the analysis for planar junctions with non-equal Fermi velocities and for non-planar junctions (narrow normal bridge between two bulk superconductors) are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on Voltage-controlled Superconducting Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for cryogenic electronics in superconducting and quantum computing systems calls for ultra energy efficient data conversion architectures that remain functional at deep cryogenic temperatures.In this work, we present the first design of a voltage-controlled superconducting flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on a novel quantum enhanced Josephson junction field effect transistor (JJFET).Exploiting its strong gate tunability and transistor-like behavior, the JJFET offers a scalable alternative to conventional current controlled superconducting devices while aligning naturally with CMOS style design methodologies.Building on our previously developed Verilog A compact model calibrated to experimental data, we design and simulate a three bit JJFET based flash ADC.The core comparator block is realized through careful bias current selection and augmented with a three terminal nanocryotron to precisely define reference voltages.Cascaded JJFET comparators ensure robust voltage gain, cascadability, and logic level restoration across stages.Simulation results demonstrate accurate quantization behavior with ultra-low power dissipation, underscoring the feasibility of voltage driven superconducting mixed signal circuits.This work establishes a critical step toward unifying superconducting logic and data conversion, paving the way for scalable cryogenic architectures in quantum classical co-processors, low-power AI accelerators, and next generation energy constrained computing platforms.</description>

      <title>An Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) Method Realized: A case study in GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-induced defects can have a significant impact on the longevity and performance of semiconductor devices. We present an Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method that integrates first-principles defect properties and experimentally measured parameters into a device model to dynamically simulate the defect chemistry in semiconductors. For a silicon-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) material, we showcase three capabilities: (i) Fermi level $E_F$ movement including its component electron and hole Fermi levels, (ii) dynamical charge equilibration with the arsenic vacancy serving as an example, and a (iii) diffusion-driven reaction between Coulomb attracted gallium interstitial ($Ga_i$) and arsenic vacancy ($v_{As}$). Governed by charge carrier reactions, the electron and hole Fermi levels remained dissimilar until equilibrium was achieved at $E_F\approx1.32$ eV. The equilibrium Fermi level was verified by successfully identifying $v_{As}^{3-}$ as the most populated charge state within the arsenic vacancy defect. Lastly, a Coulomb attraction, created by the shifted Fermi level and the charge equilibration process, between $Ga_i^{1+}$ and $v_{As}^{3-}$ resulted in the formation of a doubly negative gallium antisite ($Ga_{As}^{2-}$). The AIDE method can access experimentally inaccessible short-time and low-concentration regimes, is generalizable to other more complex systems (e.g., indium gallium arsenide), and, after solving open problems in GaAs, will serve as a virtual experiment to bound estimates for difficult-to-measure physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Dirac semimetal strontium iridate thin films with strong spin-orbit interaction for magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural crystal features, electron transport and magnetotransport of the epitaxial strontium iridate (SrIrO$_3$) and iridate/manganite SrIrO$_3$/La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ heterostructure have been investigated. The influence of epitaxial strain relaxation caused by the lattice mismatch between SrIrO$_3$ films and five substrates: SrTiO$_3$, NdGaO$_3$, (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$, LaAlO$_3$, and Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$ on electron and magnetic transport has been observed. A pronounced impact of strong spin-orbit interaction on characteristics of SrIrO$_3$ films has been revealed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetoresistance and Hall-resistance measurements at temperatures T = 2-300 K. These findings highlight the tunability of spin-orbit-driven transport phenomena in strain-controlled SrIrO$_3$-based epitaxial systems, relevant for future spintronic oxide heterostructures. The contribution of Kondo scattering on temperature dependence of SrIrO$_3$ films resistance was observed.</description>

      <title>Critical Disconnect Between Structural and Electronic Recovery in Amorphous GaAs during Recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of structure and functionality through amorphous to crystalline phase transitions is critical for predicting and designing devices for application in extreme conditions. Here, we consider both aspects of recrystallization of irradiated GaAs. We find that structural evolution occurs in two stages, a low temperature regime characterized by slow, epitaxial front propagation and a high-temperature regime above dominated by rapid growth and formation of dense nanotwin networks. We link aspects of this structural evolution to local ordering, or paracrystallinity, within the amorphous phase. Critically, the electronic recovery of the materials is not commensurate with this structural evolution. The electronic properties of the recrystallized material deviate further from the pristine material than do those of the amorphous phase, highlighting the incongruence between structural and electronic recovery and the contrasting impact of loss of long range order versus localized defects on the functionality of semiconducting materials.</description>

      <title>A Normalized Descriptor for Unbiased Screening of Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order nonlinear optical materials enable frequency doubling of light (second-harmonic generation, SHG), which is essential for optoelectronic applications ranging from materials characterization to quantum technologies. However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\chi^{(2)}$ using new databases of \textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We show that $\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\hat{d}$ as a robust, generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and optimization across broad application frequencies.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the extrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) to be comparable to the intrinsic one in roughly half of the altermagnetic spin Laue groups in the limit of large exchange splitting. In materials with a finite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interaction, the extrinsic contribution is essential even in the clean limit. In other altermagnets it is mostly negligible. This peculiar behavior is linked to the nonanalytic dependence of the intrinsic AHC on spin-orbit coupling. Both originate from the lifting of the spin degeneracy along the nodal planes as the weak spin-orbit coupling breaks the nonrelativistic spin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Finding the stable mechanism of ring solitons in two-dimensional Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the stable mechanism of a ring soliton in two-dimensional Fermi superfluids by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and their time-dependent counterparts. In the uniform situation, we discover that the ring soliton is always driven away from its initial location, and moves towards the edge due to a curvature-induced effective potential. The ring soliton is impossible to remain static at any location in the uniform system. To balance the density difference between the ring soliton's two sides, a harmonic trap is introduced, which can exert an effect to counterbalances the curvature-induced effective potential. This enables the ring dark soliton to become a stable state at a particular equilibrium position r_s, where the free energy of the ring dark soliton just reaches the maximum value. Once ring soliton is slightly deviated from r_s, some stable periodic oscillations of ring soliton around r_s will turn out. Some dissipation will possibly occur to ring soliton once its minimum radius is comparable to the healing length of soliton's Friedel oscillation. This dissipation will increase the oscillation amplitude and finally make the ring soliton decay into sound ripples. Our research lays the groundwork for a more in-depth understanding of the stable mechanism of a ring dark soliton in the future.</description>

      <title>Bistability and Exact Reflectionless States in Nonlinear Scattering of a Bose--Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mean-field scattering dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate interacting with a Rosen--Morse potential. For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Mysterious Role of Cap Configuration in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Catalytic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of cap structure during the nucleation and growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is essential for achieving chirality-controlled synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel and intuitive algorithm to determine the chirality of nascent carbon caps by tracking the relative shifts of six pentagons within a topological coordinate system. Based on this algorithm, we propose three routes of pentagon shifts for the chirality mutations from armchair (AC) to near-AC caps, namely the transverse shift (n,n) to (n+1,n-1), inward shift (n,n) to (n-1), and outward shift (n,n) to (n+1,n), can occur according to the energy profiles calculated based on the density function theory (DFT), providing a new perspective to explain the experimental abundance of near-AC SWCNTs. After that, we construct 24 representative short caps and long SWCNTs with different chiralities and symmetries, and perform DFT calculations to evaluate their thermodynamic stability and deformation behaviors on flat Ni(111) surfaces and curved Ni55 particle, respectively. The results reveal that cap topology and catalyst curvature together induce dual deformations that significantly influence the formation and interface energies. Notably, AC and near-AC caps exhibit superior flexibility and robust energetic advantages, especially the (6,6) cap with C6v symmetry. A linear correlation between cap-induced deformation and formation energy is established through a defined shape factor, highlighting the interaction between cap structure and catalyst interface as a key driver of chirality selection. This study theoretically reveals the cap evolution mechanism and lays the foundation for the rational design of SWCNT growth strategies.</description>

      <title>Tunable Multistage Refrigeration via Geometrically Frustrated Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet for Space Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature refrigeration technology constitutes a crucial component in space exploration. The small-scale, low-vibration Stirling-type pulse tube refrigerators hold significant application potential for space cooling. However, the efficient operation of current Stirling-type pulse tube cryocoolers in space cooling applications remains challenging due to the rapid decay of the heat capacity of regenerative materials below 10 K. This study adopts a novel material strategy: using a novel high-spin S = 7/2 magnetic regenerative material, Gd2O2Se, we construct a multistage tunable regenerative material structure to achieve an efficient cooling approach to the liquid helium temperature range. Under substantial geometric frustration from a double-layered triangular lattice, it exhibits two-step specific heat transition peaks at 6.22 K and 2.11 K, respectively. Its ultrahigh specific heat and broad two-step transition temperature range effectively bridge the gap between commercially used high-heat-capacity materials. Experimental verification shows that when Gd2O2Se is combined with Er3Ni and HoCu2 in the Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler, the cooling efficiency of the pulse tube increases by 66.5 % at 7 K, and the minimum achievable temperature reaches 5.85 K. These results indicate that Gd2O2Se is an ideal magnetic regenerative material for space cooling</description>

      <title>Lorentz Skew Scattering Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials with broken inversion symmetry, nonreciprocal magneto-transport (NRMT) manifests as a bilinear dependence of charge conductivity on applied electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in symmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel rectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies generally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic scaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT microscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the discovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges from the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical field effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over other possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba splitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it unveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a universal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time in topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation rectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in correlated topological metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations. Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$ compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e modulated quantum spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids. This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid candidates such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work, we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material 1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We observe the emergence of a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are consistent with a modulated $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state. Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\'e modulations on potential quantum liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Axial phono-magnetic effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axial or circularly polarized phonons are collective lattice vibrations with angular momentum. Over the past decade they have emerged as a promising mechanism for the manipulation of magnetism, in parallel to well established optical protocols. In particular, coherent axial phonons were shown to induce magnetization in materials without spin-ordering, making them a viable tool for ultrafast magnetic switching. The experimental evidence suggests that the size of this magnetization is significant, opening a new research area on the phono-magnetic effect. Remarkably, the coupling of axial phonons to magnetism has been observed a broad class of materials, pointing to a universal nature of the underlying mechanisms. In this review article, we present the recent progress in the field. We give an introduction to the phenomenological perspective and an overview of the experimental evidence for the magnetization emerging from axial phonons, which includes discussing the observations of phonon Zeeman effect, the magneto-optical Kerr effect and the proximity-induced magnetization switching. We present recently proposed microscopic theories for the phono-magnetic effects, based on perturbation theory, adiabatic motion and Floquet theory as well as the emergence of the phonon magnetic moment due to artificial gauge fields or inertial effects. This summary allows us to see correspondences between the seemingly different theoretical approaches, facilitating a more complete perspective of the effect.</description>

      <title>Core-Shell Confinement Blocks Hydride Formation: The Impact of Surface Oxides on Hydrogen Sorption in Nanoporous FeTi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal hydrides remain an intriguing alternative to conventional gaseous and liquid hydrogen storage methods, offering high volumetric storage density and enhanced hydrogen storage safety at ambient conditions. In this regard, the intermetallic compound FeTi is one of the most promising storage materials. However, its widespread industrial application remains challenging due to the need for activation, slow initial kinetics, large hysteresis, and high material costs. In this study, we aim to overcome these limitations by devising an alternative synthesis pathway to prepare nanoporous and ultra-fine porous FeTi with controlled grain and ligament sizes, allowing us to study the obtained well-defined microstructures in detail. In particular, we observe the confinement of the FeTi phase by surface oxides, which can be correlated with the hydrogen sorption properties of the respective material. These experimental results are further supported by an analytical model allowing the calculation of the absorption pressure as a function of microstructure-dependent elastic stresses. Additionally, we show that such stresses also influence the absorption-desorption hysteresis. This study lays the groundwork for the controlled and systematic study of the processing-structure-properties relations in metal hydrides and FeTi in particular, thereby paving the way to cost-effective and efficient hydrogen storage solutions based on metal hydrides.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes, i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when including perturbations.</description>

      <title>Giant field-tunable nonlinear Hall effect by Lorentz skew scattering in a graphene moire superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\mu}mV-1{\Omega}-1) near van Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient, magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond electrostatic gating.</description>

      <title>Development of a magnetic interatomic potential for cubic anti-ferromagnets: the case of NiO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential for molecular dynamics simulations of magnetic materials, yet incorporating magnetic features into potentials for complex antiferromagnets remains challenging. Nickel oxide (NiO), a prototypical cubic antiferromagnet, exemplifies this difficulty. Here we develop a methodology to integrate magnetic properties into interatomic potentials for cubic antiferromagnets by adding a magnetic Hamiltonian which includes both the Heisenberg exchange and N\'eel model. We apply this approach to NiO by constructing two potentials: one based on the Born model of ionic solids and another using a reference-free modified embedded atom method. Both potentials include magnetoelastic interactions and are validated against Density Functional Theory calculations, showing excellent agreement in mechanical and magnetic properties at zero temperature. These models enable large-scale simulations of magnetoelastic phenomena in antiferromagnets and open avenues for molecular dynamics studies involving coupled electric and magnetic fields in metal oxides.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of the Meissner and the Becker-London effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that the most fundamental property of a superconductor is that it exhibits the Meissner effect. Of similar importance is the Becker-London effect, i.e. generation of magnetic field inside a rotating superconductor. Hirsch has recently pointed out that, within the conventional theory of superconductivity, the question about how these effects are generated dynamically has not even been asked yet. Here we fill in this gap in the literature by a detailed study of the evolution of the electromagnetic field for both of these effects. To this end, we solve the Maxwell equations supplemented by the simplest conventional constitutive equation for a superconductor, namely the London equation. We demonstrate that, contrary to the expectations of Hirsch, the conventional theory does correctly describe the dynamics of both, the Meissner and the Becker-London effect. We find that the dynamics of the studied processes is quite rich and interesting even at this level of description.</description>

      <title>Statistical imaging of NV centers reveals clustered defect formation in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sharp optical resonances of NV- centers in diamond at cryogenic temperatures offer powerful new capabilities for material characterization, but extracting the most detailed information typically requires careful calibration of individual sensors, limiting scalability. In this work, we use resonant photoluminescence excitation imaging to optically resolve and monitor hundreds of individual NVs across large fields of view, enabling statistical analysis of their spatial distribution with sub-diffraction resolution. This multiplexed, non-destructive approach allows quantum sensors to characterize the material platform they inhabit. Focusing on CVD-grown diamond, we uncover significant deviations from random distributions, including an unexpectedly high occurrence of closely spaced clusters comprising two or more NVs. These findings suggest non-Poissonian formation dynamics and point to spatially correlated defect generation mechanisms. Beyond offering insight into diamond growth and NV center formation, our approach enables the scalable identification of naturally occurring NV clusters - configurations that are promising for entanglement-assisted quantum information protocols and correlated sensing - and establishes a path toward structural and electronic defect analysis in various material hosts at the single-emitter level.</description>

      <title>SC$^*$ Superconductivity and Spin Stiffnesses in the SU(2) Gauge Theory of the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, where the electron field is fractionalized in terms of spinons and chargons. In this theory, spinons are described by a non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs. Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Slot Plasma Excitations in a AlGaN/GaN Plasmonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the terahertz spectrum of plasma excitations in a plasmonic crystal based on AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron system (2DES). While screened plasmon modes with linear dispersion are readily observed in the plasmonic crystals, the existence of unscreened modes localized in the slots between the gates has remained unobserved until now. We discover this slot plasma excitation exhibiting square-root dispersion. It turned out that these slot plasmons follow an unconventional wave-vector quantization rule, $q_u=(N + 1/4) \times \pi/l_u$ for even integers $N$, and require the condition for excitation $q_u h \ll 1$, where $h$ is the gate-to-2DES distance and $l_u$ is the slot width. We develop an analytical model that accurately captures the found dispersion and relaxation, revealing a non-trivial $-\pi/4$ phase shift upon plasmon reflection at the gate edge. Experiments demonstrate that the slot plasmons persist up to room temperature, thereby enabling a broad range of opportunities for the advancement of plasmonic devices.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Deconfined Quantum Criticality in Non-Hermitian Easy-Plane $J$-$Q$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) characterizes the continuous transition beyond Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, occurring between two phases that exhibit distinct symmetry breaking. The debate over whether genuine DQCP exists in physical SU(2) spin systems or the transition is weakly first-order has persisted for many years. In this letter, we construct a non-Hermitian easy-plane $J$-$Q$ model and perform sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation to explore the impact of non-Hermitian microscopic interactions on the transition that potentially features a DQCP. Our results demonstrate that the intensity of the first-order transitions significantly diminishes with the amplification of non-Hermitian interactions, serving as numerical evidence to support the notion that the transition in $J$-$Q$ model is quasi-critical, possibly in the vicinity of the fixed point governing DQCP in the complex plane, described by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT). The non-Hermitian interaction facilitates the approach towards such a complex fixed point in the parameter regime. Furthermore, our QMC study on the non-Hermitian J-Q model opens a new route to numerically investigating the nature of complex CFT in the microscopic model.</description>

      <title>Structural characterization and bonding energy analysis for plasma-activated bonding of SiCN films: A reactive molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-activated bonding of SiCN films offers high bonding strength at the hybrid-bonding interface, thereby enhancing mechanical reliability. Although experimental studies have shown that the interfacial bonding properties of SiCN films vary with SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters, a clear correlation between these parameters and the resulting bonding properties has not yet been established. This study presents an atomistic investigation of SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding with controlled SiCN composition and plasma fluence, which performs O2 plasma surface activation, surface hydroxylation, direct bonding, post-bonding annealing, and debonding using reactive molecular dynamics. The structural characterization of the plasma-activated SiCN surface, including density of various covalent bonds and surface roughness, exhibits composition- and plasma fluence-dependent chemical and morphological modification. Bonding energy evaluated from atomic traction-separation responses in cohesive zone volume elements (CZVE) during debonding simulations shows a positive correlation with the interfacial Si-O-Si density. Since the interfacial Si-O-Si density reflects the combined effects of these chemical and morphological modifications, the dependence of bonding energy on composition and plasma fluence is successfully elucidated by the structural characterization. These results establish an atomic-level material-process-property relationship and offer practical guidance for optimizing SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters for SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding.</description>

      <title>Topological transition and emergent elasticity of dislocation in skyrmion lattice: Beyond Kittel's magnetic-polar analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic and polar skyrmions exhibit topologically protected quasiparticle behavior, including emergent fields, deformation, and the formation of a densely packed skyrmion lattice, beyond conventional domain configurations described by Kittel's law. Analogous to atomic crystals, lattice defects, especially dislocations and their associated strain fields, are crucial for understanding the lattice behavior of skyrmions; however, their features and roles remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that magnetic skyrmion dislocations develop a core-split structure due to a significant skyrmion elongation up to 180% of their original length, reaching a topological transition from a single skyrmion to two half-skyrmions. Despite such a distinct structure, the long-range strain fields around the dislocation perfectly obey conventional Volterra's elasticity theory, in contrast to polar skyrmion lattices, where skyrmion deformations cause a breakdown of the elasticity theory. Furthermore, an energetic analysis shows that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives the large skyrmion deformation of the dislocation core. Our findings not only clarify the coexistence of topological core-reconstruction and a robust long-range elastic field of dislocations in magnetic skyrmion lattices, but also reveal that magnetic and electric domains, long regarded as dual and analogous, exhibit fundamental differences when extended into the regime of collective topological quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Switching perpendicular magnets for Processing-in-memory with voltage gated Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data transfer latency by rolling memory and logic elements into one compute location. As an emergent material candidate for such an architecture, we propose a strained Weyl semimetal based spin-orbit-torque random-access memory (SWSM-SOTRAM) device. The spin-orbit torque (SOT) originates from two mechanisms: (1) the inverse spin Galvanic effect (iSGE), which generates nonequilibrium in-plane spin accumulation at interfaces, and (2) a bulk spin Hall effect (SHE), which produces a transverse spin current carrying out-of-plane spin angular momentum. The latter is tunable via an exchange Zeeman field. Both effects are evaluated using the tight-binding model coupled with a nonequilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF) formalism for quantum transport. Information write is achieved through SOT switching of an out-of-plane free magnet. A piezo attached to a magnetostrictive selector modulates the strain in the latter, leading to the rotation of the magnetization and hence the exchange Zeeman field exerted on the Weyl semimetal. This strain-controlled exchange field enables the symmetry tuning of the Weyl semimetal and modulation of its spin Hall effect. The TB-NEGF calculations of SHE and iSGE, combined with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of magnetization dynamics, establish the SOT switching mechanism and demonstrate a pathway toward the SWSM-SOTRAM PIM device.</description>

      <title>Inertial Repulsion from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in the magnon spectrum of 2D altermagnets via continuous similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum effects on magnon excitations in a minimal spin-1/2 Heisenberg model for 2D altermagnets on the square lattice. A continuous similarity transformation is applied in momentum space to derive an effective Hamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations. This allows us to quantitatively calculate the one-magnon dispersion, the effects of magnon-magnon interactions, and the dynamic structure factor in a certain range of parameters. In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of generators, which signal either the breakdown of the N\'eel-ordered phase or the presence of significant magnon decay.</description>

      <title>Realization of repulsive polarons in the strongly correlated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile impurities interacting with a quantum medium form quasiparticles known as polarons, a central concept in many-body physics. While the quantum impurity problem has been extensively studied with ultracold atomic gases, repulsive polarons in the strongly correlated regime have remained elusive. Typically, the impurity atoms bind into molecules or rapidly decay into deeper lying states before they can acquire an appreciable dressing cloud. Here, we report on the realization of polarons in a strongly repulsive quasi-two-dimensional quantum gas. Using a superfluid of $^6$Li dimers, we introduce impurities by promoting a small fraction of the dimers into higher levels of the transverse confining potential. These novel synthetic-spin polarons give access to the strongly repulsive regime where common decay channels are suppressed. We extract key polaron properties - the energy, quasiparticle residue, and effective mass - using trap modulation and Bragg spectroscopy. Our measurements are well captured by a microscopic T-matrix approach and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, revealing deviations from mean-field predictions. In particular, we measure a significant enhancement of the polaron mass, with values exceeding twice the free dimer mass. Our demonstration of a stable repulsive Bose polaron establishes a platform for studying impurity physics in low-dimensional and strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous proof that arbitrarily weak perturbations produce localized vibrational (phonon) modes in one- and two-dimensional discrete lattices, inspired by analogous results for the Schr{\"o}dinger and Maxwell equations, and complementing previous explicit solutions for specific perturbations (e.g., decreasing a single mass). In particular, we study monatomic crystals with nearest-neighbor harmonic interactions, corresponding to square lattices of masses and springs, and prove that arbitrary localized perturbations that decrease the net mass lead to localized vibrating modes. The proof employs a straightforward variational method that should be extensible to other discrete lattices, interactions, and perturbations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Ferromagnetism from Planar Defects in EuSn2As2 Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of nano-scale structural peculiarities of the antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn2As2, and show that they are responsible for its puzzling magnetic properties. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of planar defects in the lattice of the studied single crystals. Using a combination of microstructural and DFT analysis we demonstrated that a single planar nano-defects forms a layer of a distinct phase EuSnAs2, that is different from the EuSn2As2 phase of the bulk lattice. The smaller distance between Eu layers in the planar nano-defect promotes formation of local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Eu atoms. On average, the planar defects form a weak ferromagnetic phase in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice. The obtained results explain several puzzling features in magnetic properties of A-type AFM materials: the nonlinear magnetization in low in-plane fields, ferromagnetic-type hysteresis in low field, and the upturn of the magnetic susceptibility in the AFM state at temperatures approaching zero.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonon Negative Refraction via Interfacial Momentum Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative refraction of coherent phonons is crucial for thermal management and quantum information processing, but it remains unrealized because achieving the suitable dispersion for negative refraction simultaneously with long-range coherence is challenging. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching, resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal transport.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently identified as a third class of collinear magnetic materials, have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. Despite this growing interest, the realization of real Chern insulators in intrinsic altermagnetic systems has rarely been reported. In this work, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O as a novel class of two-dimensional altermagnetic real Chern insulators. We demonstrate that these materials possess altermagnetic ground states and host a nontrivial mirror real Chern number, leading to the emergence of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional corner states. Notably, these corner modes are spin-polarized, giving rise to a unique spin-corner coupling effect. We further show that the real Chern insulating phases and their associated corner states remain robust against spin-orbit coupling, as well as under both uniaxial and biaxial strain. Additionally, these materials exhibit pronounced linear dichroism and strong optical absorption. Our findings uncover the novel topological character of Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O, establishing them as promising platforms for exploring real Chern insulators in altermagnetic systems.</description>

Abstract: There has been experimentally implemented a technique of neutralization of an acoustoelectric domain under the conditions of the lateral transport of charge carriers in strong electric fields in the multilayer InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures with quantum wells. The technique is implemented by means of deposition of a shunting semi opaque silver film on the heterostructure surface between the ohmic contacts. In absence of shunting the domain appearance leads to current decrease, current oscillations and also to a strong decrease of the band-to-band emission during a voltage pulse applied to the sample. The shunting eliminated the current decrease and enabled it to strongly enlarge the band-to-band emission intensity.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable single terahertz meta-atom ultrastrong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator (cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to $\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in identifying the origin of single-photon emission in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with proposed candidates including boron and nitrogen vacancies as well as carbon substitutional dopants. Because photon emission intensity often increases with sample thickness, hBN flakes used in these studies commonly exceed 30 atomic layers. To identify potential emitters at the atomic scale, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) is frequently employed. However, due to the intrinsic AA' stacking of hBN with vertically alternating boron and nitrogen atoms, this approach is complicated even in few-layer systems. Here, we demonstrate using STEM image simulations and experiments that, even under idealized conditions, the intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic layers (ca. 6 nm). While vacancy-type defects can remain detectable at somewhat larger thicknesses, also their detection becomes unreliable at thicknesses typically used in photonic studies. We further show that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial contrast differences between columns, which may result in misidentification of atomic defects. We systematically study the effects of non-radially symmetric aberrations on multilayer hBN and demonstrate that even small residual threefold astigmatism can significantly distort the STEM contrast, leading to misleading interpretations.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU Parallelization of Electronic Transport and Nonequilibrium Dynamics from Electron-Phonon Interactions in the Perturbo Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions computed from first principles is widely used to study electronic transport and nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. Calculating the e-ph collision integral is the most important step in the BTE, but it remains computationally costly, even with current MPI+OpenMP parallelization. This challenge makes it difficult to study materials with large unit cells and to achieve high resolution in momentum space. Here, we show acceleration of BTE calculations of electronic transport and ultrafast dynamics using graphical processing units (GPUs). We implement a novel data structure and algorithm, optimized for GPU hardware and developed using OpenACC, to process scattering channels and efficiently compute the collision integral. This approach significantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and synchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the open-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach achieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics on GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs. The novel data structure can be generalized to other electron interactions and scattering processes. We released this GPU implementation in the latest public version (v3.0.0) of Perturbo. The new MPI+OpenMP+GPU parallelization enables sweeping studies of e-ph physics and electron dynamics in conventional and quantum materials, and prepares Perturbo for exascale supercomputing platforms.</description>

      <title>An Extensible Julia Toolkit for Symmetry-Aware Dual Space Phasing in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source Julia-based software toolkit for solving the phase problem using dual-space iterative algorithms. The toolkit is specifically designed for aperiodic crystals and quasicrystals, supporting general space group symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. A key feature is the symmetry-breaking anti-aliasing sampling scheme, optimized for computational efficiency when working with strongly anisotropic diffraction data, common for quasicrystals. This scheme avoids sampling redundancy caused by symmetry constraints, imposed during phasing iterations. The toolkit includes a reference implementation of the charge flipping algorithm and also allows users to implement custom phasing algorithms with fine-grained control over the iterative process.</description>

      <title>Intercalation induced quasi-freestanding layer in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is employed to study the electronic structure of bulk TiSe2 before and after doping with potassium impurities. A splitting in the conduction band into two branches is observed after room-temperature deposition. The splitting energy increases to approximately 130 meV when the sample is cooled to 40 K. One branch exhibits a non-dispersive two-dimensional feature, while other one shows the characteristics of three dimensional bulk band dispersion. Core level spectroscopy suggests that the K impurities predominantly occupy the intercalated sites within the van derWaals gap. The results indicate the formation of a quasi-freestandingTiSe2 layer. Additionally, doping completely suppresses the periodic lattice distortion in the surface region. These findings are further supported by density functional theory calculations, which compare the band structure of monolayer and bulk TiSe2 with experimental data. Thus, the dimensional and intrinsic electronic properties of 1T-TiSe2 can be controlled through the intercalation procedure used in this work.</description>

      <title>Observation of phase memory and dynamical phase transitions in spinor gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing ultracold spinor gases as large-scale, many-body quantum simulation platforms, we establish a toolbox for the precise control, characterization, and detection of nonequilibrium dynamics via internal spinor phases. We develop a method to extract the phase evolution from the observed spin population dynamics, allowing us to define an order parameter that sharply identifies dynamical phase transitions over a wide range of conditions. This work also demonstrates a technique for inferring spin-dependent interactions from a single experimental time trace, in contrast to the standard approach that requires mapping a cross section of the phase diagram, with immediate applications to systems experiencing complex time-dependent interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate experimental access to and control over non-ergodic relaxation dynamics, where states in the (nominally) thermal region of the energy spectrum retain memory of the initial state, via the manipulation of spinor phases, enabling the study of non-ergodic thermalization dynamics connected to quantum scarring.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and Peierls distortion in Dirac semimetal CaMnBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals of the form $A$Mn$X_2$ ($A =$ alkaline-earth or divalent rare earth; $X =$ Bi, Sb) host conducting square-net Dirac-electron layers of $X$ atoms interleaved with antiferromagnetic Mn$X$ layers. In these materials, canted antiferromagnetism can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and produce a Weyl semimetallic state. CaMnBi$_2$ was proposed to realize this behavior below $T^{*}\sim 50$ K, where anomalies in resistivity and optical conductivity were reported. We investigate single-crystal CaMnBi$_{2}$ using polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the underlying crystal and magnetic structures. The results show that the observed anomalies do not originate from spin canting or weak ferromagnetism; no measurable uniform Mn spin canting is detected. Instead, CaMnBi$_2$ undergoes a coupled structural and magnetic symmetry-lowering transition at $T^{*} = 46(2)$ K, from a tetragonal lattice with C-type antiferromagnetism to an orthorhombic phase with unit-cell doubling along the $c$ axis and minimal impact on magnetism. Analysis of superlattice peak intensities and lattice distortion reveals a continuous second-order transition governed by a single order parameter. The refined atomic displacements correspond to a zigzag bond-order-wave (BOW) modulation of Bi-Bi bonds, consistent with an electronically driven Peierls-type instability in the Dirac-electron Bi layer, long anticipated by Hoffmann and co-workers [W.~Tremel and R.~Hoffmann, \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{109}, 124 (1987); G.~A.~Papoian and R.~Hoffmann, \textit{Angew. Chem. Int.

      <title>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Incorporating QM/MM molecular dynamics into the few-mode quantization approach for light-matter interactions in nanophotonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of light-matter interactions between organic chromophores and confined photons of (plasmonic) nano-resonators, we introduce a general framework that couples ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics with few-mode field quantization to simulate light-matter interactions of molecular emitters at the nanoscale. Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly. Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system.</description>

      <title>Graphene-enabled coherent terahertz wave detection and thickness determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent detection and interferometry in the terahertz (THz) regime are key capabilities that enable applications ranging from astronomy to non-destructive testing. Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength thickness accuracy of $\sim$5 $\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10 nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity - without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation wireless communication, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Force-Based Reading and Writing of Individual Single-Atom Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of single-atom bits enables the realization of the highest data-density memory. Reading and writing information to these bits through mechanical interactions opens the possibility of operating the magnetic devices with low heat generation and high density recording. To achieve this visionary goal, we demonstrate the use of magnetic exchange force microscopy to read and write the spin orientation of individual holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The spin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial anisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange forces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be written by approaching the tip closer to the holmium adatom.We explain this writing mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho adatom. These findings demonstrate the potential for information storage with minimal energy loss and pave the way for a new field of atomic-scale mechano-spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We study abelian anyons at the mean-field/almost-bosonic level, whose dynamics are governed by the Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger system. We consider the dimensional reduction of this 2D model by introducing an anisotropic trapping potential, and derive an effective 1D model after tracing out the tight confinement direction. The resulting effective dynamics in the loose confinement direction is captured by a quintic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We rigorously establish this dimensional reduction process in the sense of ground state energies and time-dependent solutions, under an $H^2$ well-posedness assumption.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the momentum distribution of a three-dimensional Fermi gas in the mean-field scaling regime in a trial state that was recently proven to reproduce the Gell-Mann-Brueckner correlation energy for Coulomb potentials. For a class of potentials including the Coulomb potential we show that the momentum distribution is given by a step profile corrected by a random phase approximation contribution as predicted by Daniel and Vosko. Moreover, for potentials with summable Fourier transform we provide optimal error bounds for the deviation from the random phase approximation. This refines a recent analysis by two of the authors to the physically most relevant potentials and to momenta closer to the Fermi surface.</description>

Abstract: The Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble serves as a qualitative phenomenological model for the level statistics and fractality of eigenstates across the many-body localization transition in static systems. We propose a unitary (circular) analogue of this ensemble, which similarly captures the phenomenology of many-body localization in periodically driven (Floquet) systems. We define this ensemble as the outcome of a Dyson Brownian motion process. We show numerical evidence that this ensemble shares some key statistical properties with the Rosenzweig-Porter ensemble for both the eigenvalues and the eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: In the present investigation (2002) the current-voltage characteristics (CVCs) of break junctions in polycrystalline $MgB_2$ samples have been studied in the temperature range $4.2 K &lt; T &lt; T_c$. An inelastic Cooper pair tunneling accompanied by the emission of Leggett plasmons has been found for the first time in $MgB_2$ Josephson contacts. A fine structure in the CVCs of $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts caused by a resonant emission of Leggett plasmons has been observed for the first time. An energy of the Leggett plasmon has been estimated: $E_0$ ~ 4 meV. Distinct two-gap structures have been found in the CVCs of $MgB_2$ tunneling contacts and $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts with 7.5 meV $&lt; \Delta_L &lt;$ 11 meV and 1.5 meV $&lt; \Delta_S &lt;$ 2.5 meV. An intrinsic tunneling effect (ITE) and intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect (IMARE) have been observed due to the layered structure of $MgB_2$. The obtained experimental results give a direct evidence for a two-gap superconductivity in $MgB_2$. ("V. Tarasov's Readings", November 2002, Russia, Moscow, conference proceedings.)</description>

Abstract: We investigate the detection of quartets in hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions. Using simple models of quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads, we find that quartets are ubiquitous and show how to rigorously extract their contribution to the current-phase relation (CPR). We also demonstrate that quartets are closely related to the hybridization of Andreev bound states (ABSs) in these systems and propose a method to identify quartets directly in ABS spectra. We illustrate our method by analyzing the spectroscopic measurements of the ABS spectrum in a three-terminal Josephson junction realized in an InAs/Al heterostructure. Our analysis strongly suggests the existence of quartets in the studied hybrid system.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Magnon Engineering Enabling Significant Thermal Transport Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal conductivity, a fundamental parameter characterizing thermal transport in solids, is typically determined by electron and phonon transport. Although other transport properties including electrical conductivity and thermoelectric conversion coefficients have material-specific values, it is known that thermal conductivity can be modulated artificially via phonon engineering techniques. Here, we demonstrate another way of artificially modulating the heat conduction in solids: magnonic thermal transport engineering. The time-domain thermoreflectance measurements using ferromagnetic metal/insulator junction systems reveal that the thermal conductivity of the ferromagnetic metals and interfacial thermal conductance vary significantly depending on the spatial distribution of nonequilibrium spin currents. Systematic measurements of the thermal transport properties with changing the boundary conditions for spin currents show that the observed thermal transport modulation stems from magnon origin. This observation unveils that magnons significantly contribute to the heat conduction even in ferromagnetic metals at room temperature, upsetting the conventional wisdom that the thermal conductivity mediated by magnons is very small in metals except at low temperatures. The magnonic thermal transport engineering offers a new principle and method for active thermal management.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present measurements on in-plane Young's modulus and the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter of multilayer graphene with varying number of layers, obtained through {\it in situ} bulge tests. Accurate determination of their elastic parameters poses a significant experimental challenge due to the substantial differences in mechanical behavior between intra- and inter-layers. To address this, we develop a novel theoretical model with first-principles calculations to investigate thickness-dependent incomplete strain transfer between the layers. Our findings show that the experimentally measured elastic constants, which deviate from computed intrinsic values, fail to fully capture ideal mechanical couplings between layers. As a solution, we propose a new mechanical modulus that integrates the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter and in-plane Young's modulus, providing a more reliable representation of their mechanical properties, independent of unavoidable interlayer effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum conductors attached to metallic reservoirs have been demonstrated to overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), a trade-off relation between the amount of dissipation and the absence of charge and heat current fluctuations. Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting reservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport processes, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their retro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal quasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns. The large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative and highly stable quantum thermal machines.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental advancements in dissipation control have yielded significant insights into non-hermitian Hamiltonians for open quantum systems. Of particular interest are the topological characteristics exhibited by these non-hermitian systems, that arise from exceptional points - distinct degeneracies unique to such systems. In this study, we focus on Andreev bound states in multiterminal Josephson junctions with non-hermiticity induced by normal metal or ferromagnetic leads. By investigating several systems of different synthetic dimensions and symmetries, we predict fragile and stable non-hermitian topological phases in these engineered superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Flat Chern bands and correlated states in spiral magnet ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ hosts isolated flat Chern bands at the Fermi level in its $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic ground state. Their flatness and nontrivial topology arise from the cooperative effect of coplanar spin order and strong spin-orbit coupling within Re $5d$ orbitals-a mechanism distinct from moir\'e systems. The spiral spin texture naturally enlarges the unit cell, reducing carrier densities while preserving sizable interaction scales. Many-body calculations show that fractional fillings can support fractional Chern insulator and charge-density wave states. Remarkably, the mechanism is generic to a broad family of Re-based compounds, with both spin configuration and flat band topology tunable by electrical manipulation. Our findings establish Re-based coplanar antiferromagnets as a robust, tunable, and experimentally accessible platform for flat Chern bands and correlated topological phases potentially at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Theory of unconventional magnetism in a Cu-based kagome metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metals have established a new arena for correlated electron physics. To date, the predominant experimental evidence centers around unconventional charge order, nematicity, and superconductivity, while magnetic fluctuations due to electronic interactions, i.e., beyond local atomic magnetism, have largely been elusive. We find the challenge of locating the appropriate parameter regime for such exotic order to center around two aspects. First, the correlations implied by low-energy orbitals have to be sufficiently large to yield a dominance of magnetic fluctuations and weak to retain an itinerant parent state. Second, the kinematic kagome profile at the Fermi level demands an efficient mitigation of sublattice interference causing the suppression of magnetic fluctuations descending from electronic on-site repulsion. We elucidate our methodology by analyzing the potential copper-based kagome compound CsCu$_3$Cl$_5$: From ab initio design and many-body analysis, we develop a model framework of realistic Cu-based kagome materials the simulations of which reveal unconventional magnetic order in a kagome metal.</description>

      <title>Orbital Description of Landau Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of a lattice analogue for Landau levels has been a central theme in condensed matter physics. Although the correspondence between Chern bands and the lowest Landau level has been widely studied, a lattice realization of the first Landau level remains elusive. Here we construct a minimal lattice model that provides a concrete orbital description of both the lowest and first Landau levels. Using maximally localized Wannier functions with $s$, $p_-$, and $p_+$ orbital character, we develop a three-orbital model in which the two lowest Chern bands are flat and each carries a Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. The band topology arises from a sequence of ideal band inversions between Wannier states at the $\Gamma$ and $K$ points in momentum space, establishing an adiabatic connection between the atomic insulator limit and Landau level physics. Notably, many-body exact diagonalization reveals that the non-Abelian state can appear in the half-filled first Chern band. This construction can be further generalized to realize flat Chern bands analogous to higher Landau levels. Our results provide a new perspective on lattice analogues of Landau levels and may enable the exploration of fascinating topological phenomena at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Atomic resolution imaging of the strength and 3D direction of atomic displacements in functional oxide thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic resolution imaging is key to understanding thin film growth and how a particular set of conditions influences properties. Whilst such imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has had transformative impact in nanoscience, it forms projection images and provides no direct information about displacements perpendicular to the image plane. In this article we show that it is possible to make atomic resolution maps of the direction and magnitude of La displacements at ~30{\deg} to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6 thin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-La(Sr,Ta)O3) using a 4-dimensional STEM (4DSTEM) methodology. This reveals that the La modulation lies preferentially in the interface plane, and is strongly suppressed close to the epitaxial interface, and further reveals how the modulation varies with distance from the interface with unit cell resolution. These details would be completely invisible to all prior techniques in electron microscopy and this sheds light on why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double perovskite cation ordering, and the consequent optimal magnetic ordering for this thin film system. The approach used herein of fitting atomic resolution 4DSTEM data to determine crystal parameters opens the door for a new era of atomic-resolution crystallography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of photon-dressed energy bands in bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices under off-resonant circularly polarized light, focusing on aligned and cyclic stacking configurations. Analytical expressions for quasi-energy bands are derived for aligned stacking, while numerical results address cyclic stacking at Dirac points. Circularly polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracies at the intersections $t^{a,c}$, leading to the appearance of a Haldane-type Chern insulator in the absence of a magnetic field . At $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, orbital magnetic moments of corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, as do their Berry curvatures. For $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, light-induced band deformations near Dirac points create gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum, where the chemical potential modulates orbital magnetization. Linear magnetization variations align with Chern numbers, yielding quantized anomalous Hall conductivity across stacking types. Notable particle-hole symmetry breaking within $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ suggests applications in valley caloritronics and quantum sensing. At $\alpha = 1$, flat and corrugated bands remain undistorted; while the flat band contributes no Berry curvature, it produces a finite negative orbital magnetic moment, contrasting with the positive moment of the corrugated band.</description>

Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that rapidly simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and other scanning probe microscopy (SPM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sublattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and several charge- and bond-density wave systems.</description>

      <title>Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys using DFPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional stress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for ordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this approach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This poses a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of disordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative to stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the elastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the underlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic flexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of disordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded quantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered material properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven heterogeneity in elastic properties, and associated relaxation fields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force response internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain tensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</description>

      <title>Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prevents continuous symmetry breaking at any finite temperature, thus forbidding a Landau phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$. The difficulty arises when many-body theoretical studies predict a Landau phase transition at finite temperatures, which contradicts the Mermin-Wagner theorem and is termed a pseudo phase transition. To tackle this problem, we systematically develop a symmetrization scheme, defined as averaging physical quantities over all symmetry-breaking states, thus ensuring that it preserves the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We apply the symmetrization scheme to the GW-covariance calculation for the 2D repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime and at low temperatures, obtaining the one-body Green's function and spin-spin correlation function, and benchmark them against Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) with good agreement.The spin-spin correlation functions are approached within the covariance theory, a general method for calculating two-body correlation functions from a one-particle starting point, such as the GW formalism used here, which ensures the preservation of the fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) and Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). With the FDR and WTI satisfied, we conjecture that the $\chi$-sum rule, a fundamental relation from the Pauli exclusion principle, can be used to probe the reliability of many-body methods, and demonstrate this by comparing the GW-covariance and mean-field-covariance approaches. This work provides a novel framework to investigate the strong-coupling and doped regime of the 2D Hubbard model, which is believed to be applicable to real high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>The structural effects of (111) growth of La2CoMnO6 on SrTiO3 and LSAT -- new insights from 3D crystallographic characterisation with 4D-STEM and Digital Dark Field imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3-dimensional orientation of La atom modulations has been mapped in two thin films of La2CoMnO6 grown on SrTiO3 and LSAT ([La,Sr,Al,Ta] oxide) using a 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) method based on the recently developed Digital Dark Field method. This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra in the film grown on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Ion Conduction Enabled by Site Percolation in Random Substitutional Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and safe energy storage technologies are essential for realizing a sustainable and electrified society. Among the key challenges, the design of superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries often faces a fundamental trade-off between stability and ionic conductivity. Random substitutional crystals, where atomic species are randomly distributed throughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this trade-off. Although the importance of cooperative motion in ion conduction has been pointed out, there is a lack of understanding of the relationship between mesoscale structural organization and macroscopic conductivity, limiting the rational design of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic conductivity of rock salt random substitutional ionic crystals Li$_x$Pb$_{1-2x}$Bi$_x$Te as a function of Li concentration $x$ using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once the $x$ exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting the underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the site-percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory. Our findings establish ion percolation as a universal design principle that reconciles the trade-off between conductivity and stability, offering a simple and broadly applicable strategy for the development of robust, high-performance solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties and the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase of bulk CaTiO$_3$ from second-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A second-principles effective interatomic potential is introduced for the prototypical perovskite CaTiO$_3$ (CTO), relying on a Taylor polynomial expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface around the cubic reference structure, in terms of atomic displacements and macroscopic strains. This model captures various phases of bulk CTO and successfully reproduces, in particular, the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as of the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. Finite-temperature simulations suggest that the still debated sequence of structural phase transitions over heating is $Pbnm \ (a^-a^-c^+) \rightarrow C2/m \ (a^-b^-c^0) \rightarrow I4/mcm \ (a^-c^0c^0) \rightarrow Pm\bar{3}m \ (a^0a^0a^0)$, a sequence during which the oxygen-octahedra rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish successively. Although never experimentally observed in bulk, the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase appears to be metastable and at an energy only slightly above the $Pbnm$ ground state at zero Kelvin. The simulations confirm that, if induced in some way, the $R3c$ phase remains stable up to about 300 K and shows ferroelectric properties. Furthermore, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations, a mechanism which is shown to be at play during the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state. The proximity of the $R3c$ phase with the $Pbnm$ ground state suggests that the former could be stabilized under electric field. However, due to the large energy barrier, the field required for the $Pbnm$-to-$R3c$ transition appears to be extremely large, consistent with the fact that bulk CTO was never reported to be ferroelectric nor antiferroelectric.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze the amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can host exceptional degeneracies where not only the eigenvalues, but also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recently, $p$-wave magnets have been introduced, which are characterized by their unusual odd parity. In this work, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian degeneracies at the interface of $p$-wave magnets and ferromagnets. We demonstrate that this setup offers a remarkable tunability allowing realization of exceptional lines and rings, which can be controlled via the orientation of the $p$-wave N\'eel vector. We present the origin of these exceptional contours based on symmetry, and characterize them using phase rigidity. Our works puts forward a versatile platform to realize controllable non-Hermitian degeneracies at odd parity magnetic interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic-scale modeling of magnetic materials requires precise treatment of coupled spin-lattice degrees of freedom (DOFs). Traditional spin-lattice dynamics (SLD), employing Newtonian equation for lattice evolution and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for spin, encounters severe limitations with machine-learning potentials (MLPs), including poor energy conservation and excessive computational costs due to non-symplectic integration. In this work, we propose TSPIN, a unified Nos\'e-Hoover chain (NHC) framework that augments the spin-lattice Lagrangian with spin kinetic terms and thermostat/barostat variables, yielding a symplectic Hamiltonian formulation for NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles. The method integrates spin and lattice dynamics simultaneously, ensuring energy conservation and reducing computational cost. Benchmarks on harmonic models confirm its accuracy, while Fe simulations with the DeepSPIN potential demonstrate superior stability, efficiency, and the ability to capture magnetic phase transition. TSPIN thus provides a general and efficient framework for large-scale simulations of spin-lattice phenomena and multiple-DOF systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, but the kinetic pathway of anisotropic particle systems remains elusive, where the coupling between translational and rotational motions plays a critical role in various kinetic processes. Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics simulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon, hexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase transition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a homogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is shape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a vague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct stripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon adheres to the quasi-equilibrium assumption, whereas the pathways of hexagon and pentagon are governed by translational and rotational motion, respectively. This diversity is originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the anisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse process in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, with more diverse kinetic pathways attributed to the possible kinetic traps. Our findings promote the theoretical understanding of microscopic kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions as well as provide direct guidance for the rational design of materials utilizing desired kinetic features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

Here, the electronic structure and magnetic properties have been studied using first-principles calculations for the LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$, and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$ compounds sharing the kagome Fe$_3$Ge layer motif but with different interlayer arrangements. For LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$ and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$, the predicted magnetic ground states are collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) states involving a mix of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM interlayer orientations. Whereas for LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, an incommensurate cycloidal spin spiral is stabilized as a ground state, being close to a collinear A-type AFM state. The analysis of magnetic RKKY exchange coupling confirms the results of electronic structure calculations. The values of atomic magnetic moments are in good agreement with existing experimental estimations. Our experiments on LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$ single crystals have observed AFM ordering at ~540 K and transition to another magnetic phase, with a small FM component (possibly with spin canting), below ~270 K. Thus, our theory and experiment suggest the existence and sequence of collinear and noncollinear magnetic states in kagome LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our findings provide a platform for exploring various novel magnetic phases and associated unconventional or topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Model for Thermomigration in Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms involved in the thermomigration of interstitial hydrogen in metals. Using irreversible thermodynamics, we develop a comprehensive mechanistic model to capture the controlling effects. Crucially, through validation against published experimental data, our results demonstrate that an electron-wind effect plays a significant role, particularly for materials in which the thermomigration direction matches the heat flux. These findings provide new insights into the factors that affect the localisation of solutes in metals. Moreover, our results indicate that atomistic models may be inadequate for detailed thermomigration studies due to the omission of electronic effects.</description>

      <title>Electro-thermal Co-design of Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity BaTiO3 Field-plate for High-field and Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</description>

Abstract: We provide an overview of studies of hysteresis in models of magnets. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loop, dynamical symmetry breaking, and the dependence of the area of the loop on the amplitude and frequency of the driving field. We also discuss Barkhausen noise in the hysteresis loops, where the wide distribution of sizes of magnetization jumps may be modeled by the random-field Ising model. We discuss the distribution of sizes of these jumps in the random field Ising model on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Diagram of Generalized SSH Models with Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Momentum-Resolved Static Spin Susceptibility in a Mott-Proximate Cuprate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the temperature dependence of the static spin susceptibility at $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, 0)$ in a Mott-proximate cuprate model with an antinodal pseudogap -- a model system for high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates.
  The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\mathbf{q}=(\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly.
  It suggests that the emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\omega$ particle-hole phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases, i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Solution to a Quantum Impurity Model for Moir\'e Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S&gt;J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D&gt;J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D&gt;J_S,J_D&gt;0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S&gt;J_D,J_S&gt;0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic FeCl$_2$ monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies Imply Intrinsic Long-Range Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>
