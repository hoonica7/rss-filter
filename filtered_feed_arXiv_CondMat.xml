      <title>Emergent Interacting Phases in the Strong Coupling Limit of Twisted M-Valley Moir\'e Systems: Application to SnSe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices. In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice structure. The high tunability of the moir\'e system, which allows control over both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Group theory method for extracting order parameters from scanning tunneling microscopy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful local probe of correlated electronic states. Here we present a group theoretical framework for the analysis of STM data, filtering STM images into components which provide a real space mapping of the local symmetry properties of the underlying density of states. Using this formalism, we show that certain kinds of symmetry breaking are impossible to resolve in the first Brillouin zone, due to symmetry restrictions we term ``Bragg peak extinctions'' in analogy with related ideas in x-ray crystallography. We show extinct patterns of symmetry breaking can be resolved using sub-unit cell structure, and develop methodological details for the accurate extraction of this symmetry information. We illustrate our results on synthetic STM data for $2\times 2$ charge density waves on the kagome lattice, and on topographic data for kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Our results provide a powerful method for extracting symmetry insights from STM data, and provide constraints on when and how certain ground states are experimentally observable.</description>

      <title>Spin and thermal current scaling at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains.
  Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological) four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control in experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Universal intrinsic orbital dynamics from Berry curvature in electronic two-band systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric structure of quantum states plays a fundamental role in determining the intrinsic dynamics of electrons in solids. In this work, we study the geometric origin of orbital angular momentum and its transport in a general two-band electronic system. Without assuming any symmetry or dimensional constraints, we show that the orbital Berry curvature, which governs the orbital Hall effect, can be universally expressed as the product of the band energy and the square of the Berry curvature. This highlights the central role of Berry curvature in engineering orbital Hall responses. We also discuss the applicability of our framework by analyzing a realistic model. Our findings underscore the geometric universality of itinerant intrinsic orbital dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electronic localization on the structural inhomogeneities formed due to Bi and Te deficiency in the MBE grown films of AFM topological insulator MnBi2Te4: Evidence from spectroscopic ellipsometry and infrared studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic substitutional and antisite defects cause unintentional doping and shift of the E_F position above the conduction band minimum in the AFM topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4. This prevents measurements of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAH) and investigation of the topological Dirac states. In the present study, the Mn-Bi-Te films grown by the MBE technique onto Si(111) substrates with decreasing Bi and Te contents and increasing Mn content were investigated by 0.5-6.5 eV spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the 0.004-0.9 eV infrared (IR) transmittance spectra were examined. An effective medium model was used to reproduce the measured ellipsometric angles, Psi(omega) and Delta(omega), of the Mn-Bi-Te films in terms of the constructed model, including film thickness, surface roughness, and volume fractions of two (MnTe and Bi2Te3) or three constituents, the latter being associated with the structural inhomogeneities contribution. The results obtained for the inhomogeneous Mn-Bi-Te films using the three-phase EMA model indicate that the defect-associated optical response systematically shifts to higher photon energies from ~1.95 to ~2.43 eV with decreasing Te and Bi contents and increasing Mn content, pointing out that the electrons become more deeply localized in the formed structural inhomogeneities. The obtained results indicate that the structure of the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films is not continuous but represented by regions of nearly stoichiometric MnBi2Te4 phase, which includes hollows or quantum anti-dots (QADs). The measured FIR transmittance spectra for the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films show substantially reduced (or absent) contribution(s) from free charge carriers, which supports the relevance of localization effects.</description>

      <title>Edgetronics in 2D Altermagnet via Real-Space-Spin Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</description>

      <title>The 6H-Perovskite Dimer Lattice with Antiferromagnetic Interactions: Ba$_3$ARu$_2$O$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic behavior of the 6H-perovskite dimer lattice Ba$_3$Zn$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ru$_2$O$_9$ using analytical theory, density functional theory, inelastic neutron scattering, and modeling of historical magnetization and neutron-scattering data. A dimer mean-field theory built upon classical Luttinger-Tisza analysis generates a phase diagram revealing a transition from a nonmagnetic singlet to a finite-moment ground state as interdimer couplings increase. A (generalized) linear spin-wave theory captures multiplet mixing, excitation gap closing, and fluctuation-induced moment suppression. Density functional theory on select compounds and neutron spectroscopy on dilute Ba$_3$Zn(Ru$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$O$_9$ confirm the exchange hierarchy, enabling quantification of previously published experiments within this framework. Our results identify three mechanisms for magnetic moment suppression: quantum fluctuations, ligand hybridization, and nonmagnetic-singlet/magnetic-multiplet mixing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Graphene Electronic Band Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN) v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics, M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation -- operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from 5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\% reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085. The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.</description>

      <title>Edge Reconstruction in a Quantum Spin Hall Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction-driven edge reconstruction in a quantum spin Hall insulator described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with Kanamori-Hubbard interactions using the real-space density matrix renormalization group method in both the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. For a two-dimensional cylinder with a smooth edge, we identify discrete particle-number transitions that lead to a spin-polarized edge state stabilized by an emergent ferromagnetic exchange interaction. The reconstruction is orbital-selective, occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel. Our results reveal a fully microscopic mechanism for emergent spin polarization at the edge that could compromise the topological protection of helical edge states by time reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Formation and protection of an Eu-Ir surface compound below hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europium (Eu) intercalation below hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on an Ir(111) substrate at various Eu coverages is investigated. The structural and electronic properties were examined using low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Depending on the deposition temperature, different superstructures, (5 $\times$ $M$), (5 $\times$ 2), and ($ \sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3})R30^{\circ}$ with respect to the Ir substrate were identified by LEED. The (5 $\times$ $M$) superstructure ($M$ $&gt;$ 2), at 0.1 monolayer (ML), preserved the hBN/Ir Moir{\'e} pattern and exhibited a unidirectional ordering of Eu atoms. At higher coverage of 0.26 ML, a (5 $\times$ 2) superstructure emerged, where excess Eu atoms diffused into the bulk and were analyzed as Eu in a tri-valent state. At the highest preparation temperature with a one-third ML Eu, the formation of a ($\sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3})R30^{\circ}$ superstructure indicates the presence of a EuIr$_{2}$ surface alloy beneath the hBN layer, with di-valent Eu atoms suggesting potential ferromagnetic properties. Air exposure was used to evaluate the protection of the hBN layer, and the results indicate that the EuIr$_{2}$ surface alloy was partially protected. However, the hBN layer remained intact by intercalation and air exposure, as confirmed by ARPES analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamically tunable hydrodynamic transport in boron nitride-encapsulated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.</description>

      <title>New Materials, New Functionalities: Molecular Beam Epitaxy of Ultra-High Conductivity Oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding fundamental properties of materials is necessary for all modern electronic technologies. Toward this end, the fabrication of new ultrapure thin film materials is critical to discover and understand novel properties that can allow further development of technology. Oxide materials are a vast material class abound with diverse properties, and, therefore, harnessing such phases is critical for realizing emerging technologies. Pushing forward, however, requires understanding basic properties of insulating, semiconducting and metallic oxides, as well as the more complex phases that arise out of strong electronic correlations unique to this class of materials. In this review, we will focus on one of the unique aspects of oxides: the ultra-high conductivity metallic state, which can be a critical component for future all-oxide microelectronics such as low-loss interconnects and gate-metals, spintronics, as well as future quantum technologies that employ emergent magnetic or superconducting ground states. Like most oxides, a critical challenge to understanding and ultimately integrating high-conductivity metals into new technologies is the ability to synthesize high-quality materials. Therefore, we will frame the discussions in the context of epitaxial film growth via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which has provided insights into the electronic behavior of specific materials while providing samples with unprecedented quality. We will highlight and underscore how MBE has enabled developments and deeper understanding of their properties and how it plays a critical role in the future of this unique class of materials.</description>

      <title>Variational Time Evolution Compression for Solving Impurity Models on Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a useful tool to analyze models of strongly correlated fermions like the Hubbard model. In DMFT, the lattice of the model is replaced by a single impurity site embedded in an effective bath. The resulting single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) can then be solved self-consistently with a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm. This procedure involves repeatedly preparing the ground state on a quantum computer and evolving it in time to measure the Greens function. We here develop an approximation of the time evolution operator for this setting by training a Hamiltonian variational ansatz. The parameters of the ansatz are obtained via a variational quantum algorithm that utilizes a small number of time steps, given by the Suzuki- Trotter expansion of the time evolution operator, to guide the evolution of the parameters. The resulting circuit has constant depth for the time evolution and is significantly shallower than a comparable Suzuki-Trotter expansion.</description>

      <title>Nodal pair density waves from a quarter-metal in crystalline graphene multilayers</title>

Abstract: Crystalline graphene heterostructures, namely, Bernal bilayer graphene (BBLG) and rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTLG), for example, subject to perpendicular electric displacement fields, display a rich confluence of competing orders, resulting in a valley-degenerate, spin-polarized half-metal at moderate doping, and a spin- and valley-polarized (non-degenerate) quarter-metal at lower doping. Here we show that such a quarter-metal can be susceptible toward the nucleation of a unique spin- and valley-polarized superconducting ground state, accommodating \emph{odd-parity} (dominantly $p$ wave in BBLG and $f$ wave in RTLG) inter-layer Cooper pairs that break the translational symmetry, giving rise to a Kekul\'e (in BBLG) or columnar (in RTLG) pair density wave. Due to the trigonal warping in the normal state, the superconducting ground state produces three-fold rotationally symmetric isolated Fermi rings of normal fermions, which can manifest via linear in temperature scaling of the specific heat. We present scaling of the zero-temperature pairing amplitude and the transition temperature of such pair density wave in the presence of trigonally warped disconnected, annular, and simply connected Fermi rings in the normal state, subject to an effective attractive interaction within a mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at 10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation</description>

      <title>Van der Waals devices for surface-sensitive experiments</title>

Abstract: In-operando characterization of van der Waals (vdW) devices using surface-sensitive methods provides critical insights into phase transitions and correlated electronic states. Yet, integrating vdW materials in functional devices while maintaining pristine surfaces is a key challenge for combined transport and surface-sensitive experiments. Conventional lithographic techniques introduce surface contamination, limiting the applicability of state-of-the-art spectroscopic probes. We present a stencil lithography-based approach for fabricating vdW devices, producing micron-scale electrical contacts, and exfoliation in ultra-high vacuum. The resist-free patterning method utilizes a shadow mask to define electrical contacts and yields thin flakes down to the single-layer regime via gold-assisted exfoliation. As a demonstration, we fabricate devices from 1$T-$TaS$_2$ flakes, achieving reliable contacts for application of electrical pulses and resistance measurements, as well as clean surfaces allowing for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The approach provides a platform for studying the electronic properties of vdW systems with surface-sensitive probes in well-defined device geometries.</description>

      <title>Propylenidene: A Novel Metallic Carbon Monolayer with Unconventional Ring Topology</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have drawn significant interest owing to their impressive physical and chemical characteristics. Following graphene's isolation, a wide range of 2D carbon materials has been suggested, each with distinct electronic, mechanical, and optical traits. Rational design and synthesis of new 2D carbon structures hinge on experimentally reported precursors. Here, we present a 2D carbon allotrope, propylenidene (PPD), originating from bicyclopropylidene. PPD forms a rectangular lattice with 3, 8, and 10-membered carbon rings. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations investigate its structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Our study shows PPD to be metallic. PPD exhibits absorption in the infrared and visible range, showing directional dependence in its response. Mechanically, PPD exhibits marked anisotropy; Young's modulus ($Y$) varies between 205.83 N/m and 164.46 N/m. These findings underscore the potential of this novel monolayer in applications such as energy storage, gas sensing, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Importance of anisotropic interactions for hard-axis/plane ordering of Ce-based ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo-lattice (KL) compounds often exhibit intriguing magnetic behavior driven by strong crystal electric field (CEF) anisotropy and exchange interactions. Recent studies suggest that many Ce-based and Yb-based KL ferromagnets order along the hard-axis or hard-plane determined by their CEF ground state. We performed a survey of Ce-based FM compounds, complemented with new single crystal synthesis, magnetization measurements, and analysis of the CEF scheme. Our results reveal that hard-axis/plane ordering is less common than previously reported, with most compounds ordering along their easy-axis/plane. We also find no clear correlation between the strength of the Kondo effect and whether a compound adopts hard-axis/plane or easy-axis/plane ordering. Instead, the key driver appears to be the competition between CEF anisotropy and exchange interaction anisotropy. A direct comparison of CeCuSi and CeAgSb$_2$ further indicates that antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions along the CEF easy-axis can be crucial in stabilizing the hard-axis FM ordering observed in CeAgSb$_2$. Finally, our results suggest that an anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model could offer deeper insights into the complicated magnetic properties of Ce-based and other heavy-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Giant Shift Current in Electrically-Tunable Superlattice Bilayer Graphene</title>

Abstract: Recent introduction of superlattice potentials has opened new avenues for engineering tunable electronic band structures featuring topologically nontrivial moir\'{e}-like bands. Here we consider optoelectronic properties of Bernal-stacked graphene subjected to a superlattice potential either electrostatically or through lattice twisting to show that it exhibits a giant shift current response that is orders of magnitude larger than existing predictions in twisted mulitlayer systems. Effects of gate voltage and the strength and phase of the superlattice potential on the shift current are delineated systematically across various topological regimes. Our study gives insight into the nature of nonlinear responses of materials and how these responses could be optimized by tuning the superlattice potential.</description>

      <title>Magic angle (in)stability and mobility edges in disordered Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do experiments only observe one magic angle in twisted bilayer graphene, despite standard models like the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian predicting an infinite number? In this article, we explore the relative stability of larger magic angles compared to smaller ones. Specifically, we analyze how disorder impacts these angles as described by the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian in the chiral limit. Changing focus, we investigate the topological and transport properties of a specific magic angle under disorder. We identify a mobility edge near the flat band energy for small disorder, showing that this mobility edge persists even when all Chern numbers are zero. This persistence is attributed to the system's $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, which enables non-trivial sublattice transport. Notably, this effect remains robust beyond the chiral limit and near perfect magic angles, aligning with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Time-Independent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>
