      <title>Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice using several numerical approaches, focusing on the numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE), which exhibits an unconventional convergence extending to low and even zero temperatures. We evaluate thermodynamic properties as well as spin-spin correlations through the equal-time structure factor. Within NLCE the specific heat capacity reveals a two-peak structure at $T_1 \approx 0.479\,J$ and $T_2 \approx 0.131\,J$, reminiscent of the corresponding result for the triangular lattice. At intermediate temperatures, the spin-spin structure factor develops features that reflect the absence of reflection symmetry in the lattice. The zero-temperature convergence of NLCE enables reliable estimates of the ground-state energy and points to a short-range correlated paramagnetic ground state composed of resonating hexagonal motifs. The NLCE results are benchmarked against Pseudo-Majorana Functional Renormalization Group, finite-temperature Lanczos, and classical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>IRSSG: An Open-Source Software Package for Spin Space Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source software package IRSSG for investigating magnetic systems with spin space groups (SSGs). The package works within the density functional theory (DFT) framework and requires wavefunctions from DFT codes, such as VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, as well as any other code that has an interface to Wannier90. We introduce a set of compact SSG international symbols by combining non-crystallographic point groups with the 230 crystallographic space groups. The program first identifies all SSG operations and determines the SSG international symbol for a given magnetic system. It then generates the SSG character tables of little groups at any $k$ point. Finally, it computes the traces of matrix presentations of SSG operations and assigns irreducible corepresentation labels to magnetic energy bands. The program is not only timely but also essential for advancing research on the study of magnons, altermagnetism, magnetic topology, and novel high-degeneracy excitations in SSG systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and spectral cusps from density-wave fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two types of singularities that arise from fluctuations during the formation of charge- or spin-density waves. The first is the exceptional point (EP), corresponding to a higher-order pole of the retarded Green's function. Such EPs lead to algebraic corrections in the decay of quasiparticle occupations and are observable through time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES). The second is a spectral cusp, defined by the coalescence of three extrema in the real-frequency spectral function $A(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$. This cusp enforces the formation of Fermi arcs and induces a "threading" structure in the nearby band structure, both of which are directly observable in ARPES.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magneto-Mechanical Synergism in the Process-Structure Correlation in Fe-C Alloys: A Phase-Field Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applied magnetic fields can alter phase equilibria and kinetics in steels; however, quantitatively resolving how magnetic, chemical, and elastic driving forces jointly influence the microstructure remains challenging. We develop a quantitative magneto-mechanically coupled phase-field model for the Fe-C system that couples a CALPHAD-based chemical free energy with demagnetization-field magnetostatics and microelasticity. The model reproduces single- and multi-particle evolution during the alpha to gamma inverse transformation at 1023 K under external fields up to 20 T, including ellipsoidal morphologies observed experimentally at 8 T. Chemically driven growth is isotropic; a magnetic interaction introduces an anisotropic driving force that elongates gamma precipitates along the field into ellipsoids, while elastic coherency promotes faceting, yielding elongated cuboidal or ``brick-like" particles under combined magneto-elastic coupling. Growth kinetics increase with C content, and decrease with field strength and misfit strain. Multi-particle simulations reveal dipolar interaction-mediated coalescence for field-parallel neighbors and ripening for field-perpendicular neighbors. Incorporating field-dependent diffusivity from experiment slows kinetics as expected; a first-principles-motivated anisotropic diffusivity correction is estimated to be small (&lt;2%). These results establish a process-structure link for magnetically assisted heat treatments of Fe-C alloys and provide guidance for microstructure control via chemo-magneto-mechanical synergism.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Magnon-magnon coupling in hybrid magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal coupling of magnetic excitations (magnons) with themselves has created a new research sub-field in hybrid magnonics, i.e., magnon-magnon coupling, which focuses on materials discovery and engineering for probing and controlling magnons in a coherent manner. This is enabled by, one, the abundant mechanisms of introducing magnetic interactions, with examples of exchange coupling, dipolar coupling, RKKY coupling, and DMI coupling, and two, the vast knowledge of how to control magnon band structure, including field and wavelength dependences of frequencies, for determining the degeneracy of magnon modes with different symmetries. In particular, we discuss how magnon-magnon coupling is implemented in various materials systems, with examples of magnetic bilayers, synthetic antiferromagnets, nanomagnetic arrays, layered van der Waals magnets, and (DMI SOT materials) in magnetic multilayers. We then introduce new concept of applications for these hybrid magnonic materials systems, with examples of frequency up/down conversion and magnon-exciton coupling, and discuss what properties are desired for achieving those applications.</description>

      <title>EPW-VASP interface for first-principles calculations of electron-phonon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interface between the Vienna \textit{Ab initio} Simulation Package (VASP) and the EPW software for calculating materials properties governed by electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. Computation of the e-ph matrix elements with the finite-difference supercell approach in VASP and their fine-grid interpolation in EPW enable accurate modeling of temperature-dependent materials properties and phonon-assisted quantum processes with VASP's extensive library of exchange-correlation functionals and pseudopotentials. We demonstrate the functionality of the EPW-VASP interface by examining the superconducting gap and critical temperature in MgB$_2$ using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations, and the carrier mobility in cubic BN using the \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wigner solid in two-dimensional electron systems in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent transport experiments that reveal two-threshold voltage-current characteristics, marked by a significant increase in noise between the two threshold voltages, at low electron densities in the insulating regime in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, specifically in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the ODMR activity of the telecom range ClV center in SiC: a wavefunction theory analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, density functional theory-based high-throughput screening of point defects in 4H-SiC revealed the positively charged chlorine-vacancy (ClV) defect to be a promising quantum bit candidate emitting at telecom wavelengths, with an electronic structure analogous to the well-known NV center in diamond. Furthermore, recent infrared photoluminescence (PL) measurements on chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC have revealed new PL lines associated with the ClV defect. While the defect possesses a high-spin ground state, there is a lack of evidence of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), a key ingredient for optical spin initialization and readout. In this Letter, we employ a multireference wavefunction-based quantum chemistry method, specifically, second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) on top of a defect-localized many-body wavefunction (CASSCF), to explore the many-body electronic structure of the ClV center. We estimate photoluminescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing rates to investigate the possibility of spin polarization and ODMR activity. Our findings establish the ClV center in 4H-SiC as an optically addressable spin qubit with fiber optics compatibility in the technologically mature 4H-SiC host material, enabling the development of large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spin-lattice coupling in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor revealed by surface acoustic Rayleigh waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic order in van der Waals magnets can strongly influence their lattice dynamics, yet how this interaction manifests across different phonon length scales remains unclear. Optical phonons probe bond-scale exchange modulation and short-range spin correlations, whereas long-wavelength acoustic modes couple to uniform strain fields and are sensitive to the renormalization of the macroscopic elastic tensor associated with long-range magnetic order. Experimentally accessing these low-energy acoustic excitations in low-dimensional crystals is challenging due to their low energies and the small lateral dimensions of exfoliated samples. Here, we employ angle-resolved Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering spectroscopy to investigate the surface acoustic phonon spectrum of exfoliated NiPS3 thin films across their antiferromagnetic transition temperature. Our results show a single Rayleigh surface mode whose phase velocity exhibits a pronounced 5.5% softening upon cooling through the Neel temperature. This anomaly reflects a giant magnetoelastic renormalization of the long-wavelength elastic constants triggered by the onset of zigzag antiferromagnetic order. First-principles calculations of the full elastic tensor, combined with continuum finite-element modelling of the NiPS3/SiO2/Si heterostructure, reproduce both the Rayleigh-wave dispersion and its magnetic-order-induced shift. The obtained results reveal how microscopic exchange interactions shape macroscopic mechanical properties in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors, providing a basis for lattice-controlled magnetism and magnetically tunable phononic, magnonic, and strain-mediated spintronic device concepts.</description>

      <title>Superionicity in Ammonium Polyhydrides at Extreme Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyhydrides have been shown to form novel structures at high pressure, which may be found in the interiors of giant planets. With density functional molecular dynamics simulations we studied the behavior of ammonium polyhydride compounds with stoichiometries of NH$_7$, NH$_9$, NH$_{10}$, NH$_{11}$, NH$_{14}$, NH$_{20}$, and NH$_{24}$ which were predicted with crystal structure search methods to be metastable at 100-300~GPa. For every compound, we performed simulations at a range of temperatures (and for several compounds, pressures) covering the solid, superionic and liquid phases. We show that when heated, high pressure ammonium polyhydride compounds exhibit hydrogen superionic diffusion. We demonstrate a number of metrics by which the solid-to-superionic and superionic-to-liquid transitions can be detected from simulation data, including changes in the internal energy and pressure, formation of new chemical species, and atomic diffusion rates. We find that both the solid-to-superionic and the superionic-to-liquid transitions decrease in temperature as proton fraction increases. These trends indicate that above a proton fraction of $\sim$0.97, ammonium hydride structures are likely to directly melt instead of first exhibiting a superionic phase. Our observed melting trend further indicates that at the extreme conditions of ice giant interiors, hydrogen rich ammonium hydrides such as those studied in this work would exist predominantly as liquids rather than exhibiting a superionic phase.</description>

      <title>Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</description>

      <title>Evolving disorder in non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of disorder on wave transport has been extensively studied in Hermitian systems, where static randomness gives rise to Anderson localization. In non-Hermitian lattices, static disorder can lead to peculiar transport features, including jumpy wave evolution. By contrast, much less is known about how transport is modified when the on-site disorder evolves during propagation. Here we address this problem by investigating two pertinent non-Hermitian lattice models with disorder altered at regular intervals, characterized by a finite disorder period. In lattices with symmetric couplings and complex on-site disorder, short disorder periods suppress localization and give rise to diffusion-like spreading, while longer periods allow the emergence of jumps. In Hatano-Nelson lattices with real on-site disorder, the non-Hermitian skin effect asymptotically dominates regardless of the disorder strength, while the disorder period reshapes the drift velocity and modulates its competition with Anderson localization. These results establish evolving disorder as a novel way of tuning non-Hermitian transport.</description>

      <title>A chemical avenue to manipulate field-reentrant superconducting rivalries in infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a preliminary magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity manifested in high critical-temperature (Tc) Eu-doped infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, beyond analogous discoveries exclusively in low-Tc systems. This arises more intriguing fundamental issues about potential quantum-phase boundary and criticality between unconventional superconductivity and field-reentrant-one, which are inexplicable owing to formidable challenges in growing IL-nickelates towards later-series rare-earths. Herein, we demonstrate the 4f-orbital related quantum rivalries between high-Tc and reentrant superconductivity in (Nd1-yRE'y)1-xEuxNiO2 (RE': Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Dy) system, via opening up the chemical avenue for a quantum leap in their growths. Robust magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity with uniaxial anisotropy is validated to fringe at boundary of the superconducting dome with optimal-Tc near 40 K. Reinforced reentry is realized via introducing Gd3+ with half-filled deeper 4f-orbital energy-states, compared to Eu2+, that strengthens on-site magnetic-moment. Our findings largely enrich the superconducting phase-diagram for nickelates, establishing an ideal platform for studying 4f-related unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Anion-Free-Electron Duality and Enhanced Superconducting Role of Interstitial Anionic Electrons in Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting electrides, characterized by interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) residing in lattice cavities, has established a distinctive platform for investigating superconductors. Yet the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation remain poorly understood due to the challenges in directly observing IAEs. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we certify that the IAEs in electride La3In (Tc = 9.4 K) exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. With the finite-depth potential well model, we trace that IAEs originate from electronic states near the Fermi level located above potential barriers, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, triggering superconductivity. ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling. Our findings resolve the long-standing ambiguity regarding the electronic nature of IAEs, elucidate their enhancing superconductivity in the phonon-mediated mechanism, and provide a foundation for exploring advanced electride-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electric Current Control of Helimagnetic Chirality from a Multidomain State in the Helimagnet MnAu$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the domain wall dynamics under electric current in the helimagnet MnAu$_2$. We have found that the threshold electric current of the transition from a multidomain state to a single-chiral domain state in a magnetic field is much lower than that of chirality reversal from a single-chiral domain within certain ranges of temperature and magnetic field. The chirality after the transition depends on whether the magnetic field and electric current were parallel or antiparallel. Numerical calculations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation reproduced the experimental observations. These results indicate that the domain walls are highly mobile in the helimagnet.</description>

      <title>Robust Paramagnon and Acoustic Plasmon in a Photo-excited Electron-doped Cuprate Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the spin and charge degrees of freedom in high-temperature superconducting cuprates under non-equilibrium conditions provides new insights into their electronic correlations. However, their collective dynamics have been largely unexplored due to experimental challenges. Here, we use time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (trRIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to simultaneously track the collective spin (paramagnon) and charge (acoustic plasmon) dynamics in an optimally electron-doped cuprate driven out-of-equilibrium by a femtosecond pump laser pulse. Upon pumping, we observed an anti-Stokes signal associated with paramagnon generation, which modifies the paramagnon dispersion near the zone center, though the bandwidth remained unchanged, suggesting no significant alteration to spin exchange interactions. Simultaneously, in the charge sector, the acoustic plasmon's energy and spectral weight decreased, suggesting a light-induced redistribution of charge carriers. The variations of both the paramagnon and the plasmon were locked in time, demonstrating a robust intertwining between the spin and charge degrees of freedom on a femtosecond timescale, even in this non-equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Scalable Synthesis of Large-Area WS2 Thin Films from Tungsten Precursors by Thermal CVD and Their Application in Schottky-Barrier Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a promising semiconductor for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, but scalable routes to uniform, large-area films remain challenging. In this study, a systematic thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy is presented to synthesize centimeter-scale WS2 thin films by sulfurizing tungsten (W) precursors in a controlled sulfur vapor environment. High-purity sputtered W thin films on SiO2/Si and W foils were sulfurized at temperatures between 400 and 1000 C, with Raman spectroscopy identifying 800 C as the optimal growth temperature. Under these conditions, the films exhibit the characteristic E12g (349.7 cm-1) and A1g (416.8 cm-1) modes with narrow full-width at half-maximum values, indicative of high crystallinity and controlled thickness. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy collectively validate the creation of stoichiometric, layered WS2 with significantly enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness when utilizing sputtered W thin films in contrast to W foils. Leveraging this optimized process, WS2 films grown on W foils were transferred onto target substrates, including indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, using a PMMA-assisted wet-transfer method that preserves structural integrity over large areas. Schottky-barrier solar cells with an Au/WS2/ITO architecture fabricated from these films deliver a short-circuit current density of 7.91 mA cm-2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.495 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.45 percent. These results demonstrate that sulfurization of W thin films and foils via T-CVD provides a scalable, substrate-compatible platform for integrating WS2 into practical optoelectronic and low-cost photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Protected valley splitting against interface disorder toward scalable silicon electron spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regardless of various material design strategies, experimentally achieving substantial and controllable valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells remains a central challenge for ensuring high gate uniformity. This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting a holon Wigner crystal in a doped Mott insulator on the kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doped quantum spin liquid on the kagome lattice provides a fascinating platform to explore exotic quantum states, such as the reported holon Wigner crystal at low doping. By extending the doping range to $\delta = 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $\delta \approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $\delta = 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $\delta = 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence. Our results reveal a quantum melting from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and suggest a doping regime to explore superconductivity for future study.</description>

      <title>Evidence for electron localisation in a moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localisation of electrons in a lattice potential is an quantum-mechanical phenomenon and is often associated with remarkable physical properties of solids involving electron spins, electric polarisations and topological effects. In particular, even a small amount of distortion of the lattice potential can localise otherwise-delocalised quantum states in low-dimensional electron systems, dramatically influencing their thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behaviour. Study of such electron localisation induced by an aperiodic lattice potential remains exceptionally challenging in solid-state systems, since extrinsic disorders can trivially trap electrons in potential minima near disorders, obscuring the underlying quantum-mechanical origin of localisation phenomena. Van der Waals heterostructures can provide an alternative route for explorations of the phenomena via the emergence of superlattice potentials generated by rotating and stacking individual layers. Here, we report strong signatures of electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene, where the interplay of two moir\'e patterns gives rise to a moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattice with distinct regions of moir\'e-periodic and moir\'e-aperiodic potentials. Remarkably, our measurements reveal the presence of double moir\'e-induced bands and high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, which are direct reflections of the periodic region with two constituent moir\'e patterns, and a superimposed anomalous hysteretic signal attributable to the aperiodic region. The data strongly suggest that electron wave functions are partially localised driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential. Our work provides insight into the effects of spatially inhomogeneous lattice potentials on the low-dimensional electronic states and introduces a promising approach to control electron localisation for practical applications in solid-state devices.</description>

      <title>Unraveling UV Stability in Metal Halide Perovskites: From Degradation Mechanisms to Molecular Passivation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of UV-induced degradation is crucial for enhancing the UV stability of perovskite solar cells. The UV-driven structural dynamics of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) are investigated using real-time TDDFT simulations, revealing that under the electron and hole excitation, the distortion of the inorganic framework (PbI) is primarily driven by the electron occupation of Pb-p and I-p antibonding states, whereas in the hole case, it is mainly governed by the direct cooling induced distortion. We also find that UV accelerates the rotation of MA+ molecules. Further, a BDO molecule is introduced as a passivant, which suppresses structural distortions and provides multi-phonon channels to dissipate carrier cooling energy. Experimental results confirm the UV-protective role of BDO, with suppressed PbI2 formation and improved device stability. These results clarify the mechanism of the UV-induced degradation in the MAPbI3 perovskite and further elucidate how passivation molecules enhance UV stability.</description>

      <title>Patterning perovskite colour converters for AR/VR microdisplays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colour conversion offers the clearest path to achieve RGB colours in high resolution microdisplays for AR/VR. With resolutions beyond 5000 ppi (i.e. RGB pitch of 5 um), the thickness of the conversion layers is critical for efficiency and manufacturing. Perovskites outperform other conversion materials (quantum dots or phosphors) with their high absorption coefficients for blue light. In this contribution, we show how perovskite materials, engineered for high optical density and colour purity, can be patterned to produce colour converting pixels. We demonstrate patterning using three approaches (lift-off, negative photoresist and dry etch), and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The results consolidate the choice of perovskites for AR/VR applications by demonstrating their robustness and compatibility with multiple patterning strategies suitable for high resolution microdisplays.</description>

      <title>N\'eel Ordered Magnetic Phases in Bipartite Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism is a fundamental research area in which the recently proposed altermagnetism (AM) has become an emergent frontier. Very recently, the quasicrystal (QC) was proposed as a possible platform to realize AM. However, the existence of AM in QCs still lacks vigorous evidence. In this work, we adopt the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to investigate the magnetic phases in the half-filled Hubbard models in various 2D bipartite QCs, and always obtain N\'eel ordered states. While the N\'eel states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the N\'eel states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding N\'eel state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively. For example, our results yield AM for the two $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QCs and FM for the $D_5$-symmetric Penrose QC at half-filling. Our results provide a solid foundation for experimental investigations and potential applications of different classes of magnetism in QCs.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Breaking Phenomena in MnPS3/TMDC Heterostructures: Non-relativistic Spin Splitting, Altermagnetism and Spin-Valley Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore symmetry-breaking phenomena in MnPS3/TMDC (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2) heterostructures using first-principles calculations, considering two high-symmetry stacking configurations, S1 and S2, which differ not only by their interfacial registry but also by a 30{\deg} twist between the layers. Depending on the stacking geometry, the systems exhibit two distinct types of nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS): S2 hosts altermagnetic-like band crossings, while S1 shows global spin splitting characteristic of symmetry-breaking NRSS. Magnetic exchange and anisotropy parameters indicate that the intrinsic magnetic properties of MnPS3 are largely preserved upon interfacing. Including spin-orbit coupling, we find tunable conduction-valley splitting controlled by the MnPS3 spin orientation. Our results identify MnPS3 as a symmetry-tunable antiferromagnetic substrate capable of inducing and controlling spin and valley effects in 2D heterostructures without relying on net magnetization or strong SOC, offering a route toward nonvolatile valleytronic functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturization is an essential element in the development of information processing technologies and is also one of the main determinants of the usability of the tested artificial neural networks. It is also a key element and one of the main challenges in the development of magnonic neuromorphic systems. In this work, we propose a new platform for the development of these new spin-wave-based technologies. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic molecules regularly arranged on the surface of a thin ferromagnetic layer enable resonant coupling of propagating spin waves with the dynamics of the molecules' magnetic moments, opening a gap in the transmission spectrum up to 150 MHz. The gap, its width, and frequency can be controlled by an external magnetic field or the arrangement of molecules on the ferromagnetic surface. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments of molecules or clusters of molecules allows for control of the gap's position and width. Thus, the proposed hybrid structure offers reprogrammability and miniaturization down to the deep nanoscale, operating frequencies in the range of several GHz, key properties for the implementation of artificial neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast thermal transport in low-dimensional materials challenges traditional diffusive models due to reduced scattering, strong electron-phonon coupling, and pronounced non-equilibrium effects. To address these complexities, we extend the macroscopic multi-temperature model by incorporating non-diffusive and non-local phenomena, treating electrons, optical phonons, and acoustic phonons as coupled but thermally distinct subsystems. We benchmark this enhanced framework against the multi-temperature Boltzmann transport equation, enabling detailed resolution of branch-dependent energy relaxation and identifying bottlenecks in thermalization. This approach provides a more accurate and comprehensive description of heat flow in emerging materials, offering novel insights into phonon dynamics and electron-phonon interactions. These theoretical advances pave the way for the improved design and optimization of next-generation nanoelectronic and photothermal devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a modeling approach based on the BSIM-IMG compact model to capture the deep-cryogenic behavior of MOSFET devices in a 22-nm FDSOI technology. The modeling flow is based on DC measurements to extract static parameters including variability and RF measurements to extract dynamic parameters. Modifications to the mobility equations are introduced to enable the modeling of intersubband scattering effect. The extracted models are used to enable deep-cryogenic simulations of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), showing close agreement with measurement results.</description>

      <title>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals.

      <title>Incommensurate-Stabilized Fractional Chern Insulator in Alternating Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) typically emerge in topological flat bands and are regarded as lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states. Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoir\'e scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems.</description>

      <title>Is the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene zero?: The case for a rational definition of the properties of atoms in a molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that the carbon atoms of graphitic samples and their finite analogs have sizable quadrupole moments, with the out-of-plane component ($Q^{\rm C}_{20}$ in traceless spherical coordinates) being the dominate contribution.
  However, there is no consensus on what the quantity is for such carbon-based systems and values reported in the literature range from $Q^{\rm C}_{20} \sim -1.14$ to $+0.79$ a.u.
  In this work we propose a theoretical framework in which well-defined statements can be made about properties of atoms-in-a-molecule (AIMs) even when these properties are not experimentally observable.
  Using this framework and the distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA), we show that the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is essentially zero within the limits of precision of the numerical method used.
  We explain how the experimentally measured atomic quadrupole moment of a graphite sample determined by Whitehouse \&amp; Buckingham likely originated almost entirely from edge dipoles, and we propose a more realistic electrostatic model for finite graphene nanoflakes.</description>

      <title>Thermally-controlled flux avalanche dynamics in bulk NbTi superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct visualization of flux avalanche propagation dynamics in bulk superconducting NbTi, tracking individual events and measuring their velocities using high-speed magneto-optical imaging. Unlike thin films with electromagnetic avalanches at km/s speeds, we observe velocities of 15--25 m/s, which are orders of magnitude slower. Analysis of characteristic timescales reveals that these avalanches are governed by local heating and limited heat dissipation through the adhesive layer, establishing a fundamentally different, thermally limited propagation regime. The threshold field for avalanche nucleation decreases with temperature, contrary to the increasing trend in thin films with efficient cooling - a behavior consistent with slow heat removal and thermal runaway in our system. All observed avalanches exhibit universal normalized velocity-distance scaling despite varying morphologies, confirming the robustness of thermal control. These findings reveal that bulk superconductors with poor thermal coupling operate in a previously uncharacterized avalanche regime, with direct implications for flux stability and quench protection in NbTi-based magnets, as well as a broader understanding of thermomagnetic instabilities in technological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric quantum Hall effect and diminished $\nu=0$ longitudinal resistance in graphene/InSe heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in graphene/InSe heterostructures and find major asymmetries in the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) and vanishing $R_{xx}$ peaks at high magnetic fields, particularly at the charge-neutrality point. Our Landauer-Buttiker analysis and numerical simulations show that a monotonically varying density gradient combined with a full equilibration mechanism can explain these phenomena. Our results also suggest the presence of trivial long-range chiral edge current and offer a broadly applicable way to engineer transport properties in quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Photoionization current spectroscopy of individual silicon vacancies in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect charge-state dynamics are central to both spin-photon interfaces and photoelectrical spin readout. Despite the significance of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) for both applications, their ionization behavior has remained unclear because their lack of optical blinking prevents conventional charge-state analysis. Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements. Our results establish photocurrent spectroscopy as a powerful complement to optical methods, advancing the development of defect-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of a Fano resonance on the measured transition time scale in solid state photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental quantum transition time scales are accessible through the spin polarization of photoelectrons coming from initially spin-degenerate states for solid-state materials . In this work we investigate the modification of this time scale in the vicinity of a Fano resonance in photoemission from a solid. We employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) to study the valence band of 1T-TiSe$_2$ and 1T-TiTe$_2$, with an excitation photon energy coinciding with the Ti 3p-3d autoionization state. The energy derivative of the measured spin polarization, which is in the off-resonance case proportional to the transition time, reveals a sign reversal and significant magnitude decrease compared to off-resonance measurements. We show that this effect goes beyond conventional semi-analytical models used to translate spin polarization to the EWS time delay. At the Fano resonance, the underlying interference assumption of the model breaks down, and additional information about resonance strength is needed to extract the transition time delays.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of residual entropy of hexagonal and cubic ices from tensor network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing question of whether the residual entropy of hexagonal ice ($S_h$) equals that of cubic ice ($S_c$) remains unresolved despite decades of research on ice-type models. While analytical studies have established the inequality $S_h \geq S_c$, numerical investigations suggest that the two values are very close. In this work, we revisit this problem using high-precision tensor-network methods. In Monte Carlo approaches the residual entropy cannot be directly obtained by sampling the ground-state degeneracy space, however, the tensor-network framework enables an explicit encoding of the "ice rule'' into local tensors, and then the residual entropy is transformed into finding the largest eigenvalue of a transfer operator in the form of a projected entangled-pair operator, which allows high-accuracy numerical evaluation. Meanwhile, we propose a new perspective based on analyzing the normality of the transfer operator, and demonstrate that if the operator is normal, the equality $S_h = S_c$ follows directly. Then the variational tensor network methods are employed to numerically verify this normality. Finally both residual entropies are directly computed by using our recently developed split corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, providing a rigorous evidence supporting the equality between $S_h$ and $S_c$.</description>

      <title>Reststrahlen band and optical bandgaps in semiconducting CrN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive optical characterization of 200-nm-thick CrN(111) films grown simultaneously on Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) and AlN/Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, spanning the far-infrared to ultraviolet range (0.04 - 5.5 eV), is conducted at room temperature to determine the optical constants $n$ and $k$ of the films. Spectral fits reveal two interband transitions at approximately 0.35 and 0.60 eV. In the infrared range, the ellipsometry data also reveals a pronounced Reststrahlen band stemming from transversal and longitudinal optical phonons at approximately 403 and 629 cm$^{-1}$, respectively. The relative static and high-frequency permittivities are estimated to be about 39 and 15, respectively. A Born effective charge of approximately 2.7, extracted from the far-infrared region, indicates that CrN is partially ionic.</description>

      <title>Screening novel cathode materials from the Energy-GNoME database using MACE machine learning force field and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we set up a screening procedure on the Energy-GNoME database for identifying novel cathode candidates. We use MACE foundational models as a first layer of screening, we assess dynamical stability and estimate the average voltage and gravimetric energy density. Following that, we apply physically motivated reasoning to identify the most promising candidates. Furthermore, we refine the average voltage prediction of selected promising candidates using DFT+U and provide the list of selected materials using this protocol. This work delivers two key outcomes: validation of the foundational MACE models high-throughput screening approach and suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation batteries. Finally, a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy GNoME database is demonstrated on the examined materials.</description>

      <title>Large out-of-equilibrium magnetocaloric effect in rare-earth zirconate pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the magnetic properties of Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ single crystals subjected to pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T using magnetization and magnetocaloric-effect (MCE) measurements, with initial temperatures ranging from 2 to 31K. The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. However, it fails to reproduce the plateau seen in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. Agreement with Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ data is improved substantially if we allow the thermal coupling between the magnetic and the lattice subsystems to depend on the product $\frac{HdH}{dt}$. Our results reveal anomalously slow heat transfer between magnetic and lattice subsystems and point toward a novel mechanism for dynamically controlling the heat flow in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ via the rate of magnetic field variation.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of magnetic skyrmions on curvilinear surfaces using local magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are promising candidates for applications in memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing. Beyond planar films, theoretical studies predict that curvature can influence skyrmion stability by introducing effective chiral interactions. Here, we investigate skyrmion formation on self-assembled polystyrene particles coated with Pt/Co/Ta multilayers by magnetron sputtering. Vibrating sample magnetometry reveals clear differences in the magnetic reversal behavior of the curvilinear film compared to that of the planar counterpart. Using non-invasive imaging methods such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and high-sensitivity in-vacuum magnetic force microscopy (MFM) with low moment magnetic tipcs, we observe a maze domain pattern for the planar films while the curvilinear film reveals three-dimensional spiraling stripe states. By employing a conventional MFM operating under ambient conditions requiring a tip with a higher magnetic moment, we demonstrate that these stripe states can rupture into metastable skyrmions located at the top of the spherical particles by applying consecutive scans. Our results demonstrate that curvilinear films offer an accessible platform for stabilizing single skyrmions using local magnetic field stimuli, opening pathways to study the interplay between interfacial and curvature-induced DMIs and enabling controlled skyrmion writing on three-dimensional magnetic architectures.</description>

      <title>Statistical characterization of the spin Hall magnetoresistance in YIG/Pt heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is widely used to study the interplay between charge and spin currents in bilayers of a magnetic insulator and a normal metal. However, not much is known about the spatial variation of the SMR across the surface of one and the same sample. In this work, we investigate the statistical distribution of the SMR in hundreds of nominally identical Hall bar structures patterned into prototypical yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/Pt heterostructures. We find a Gaussian-distributed SMR with a narrow standard deviation of approximately 10$\,$% of the mean value in each YIG/Pt bilayer studied. However, the variation of the mean SMR between different YIG/Pt samples can be as large as ~30$\,$%, despite nominally identical fabrication conditions. This demonstrates that spatial variations of the SMR amplitude must not be neglected, in particular when comparing different heterostructures. On a microscopic level, local variations of the interface quality captured by the spin mixing conductance are the most likely origin for the observed SMR amplitude variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge Kondo circuits consist of metallic islands connected by single-mode quantum point contacts (QPCs). The island's charging energy makes these circuits tunable quantum simulators of various strongly interacting models. Here we propose a circuit that realizes the Kondo effect with effective Luttinger-liquid interactions, and show that it undergoes a localization transition in which the QPC transmission is fully suppressed below a critical value. Experimental signatures include a diverging charge susceptibility and an entropy step. Our findings open a path toward realizing localization transitions in more exotic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Structural and Defect Properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</description>

      <title>Generative models for crystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in materials is fundamental in condensed matter physics and materials science. Over the past few years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing this understanding and accelerating materials discovery. Early ML approaches primarily focused on constructing and screening large material spaces to identify promising candidates for various applications. More recently, research efforts have increasingly shifted toward generating crystal structures using end-to-end generative models. This review analyzes the current state of generative modeling for crystal structure prediction and \textit{de novo} generation. It examines crystal representations, outlines the generative models used to design crystal structures, and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the review highlights experimental considerations for evaluating generated structures and provides recommendations for suitable existing software tools. Emerging topics, such as modeling disorder and defects, integration in advanced characterization, and incorporating synthetic feasibility constraints, are explored. Ultimately, this work aims to inform both experimental scientists looking to adapt suitable ML models to their specific circumstances and ML specialists seeking to understand the unique challenges related to inverse materials design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Acoustic and Optical Phonon Dispersion Mediated by Berry Curvature in Chiral Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phonon magnetochiral effect (PMCE) in chiral Weyl semimetals by deriving the nonreciprocal dispersion relations of both acoustic and non-polar optical phonons in the presence of a magnetic field. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann kinetic framework that incorporates Berry curvature, orbital magnetic moment, and node-dependent electronic structure, we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetic-field-induced corrections to the phonon dynamical matrix. Inequivalent Weyl nodes with distinct Fermi velocities, Fermi energies, and relaxation times generate a dynamical chiral imbalance that alters the phonon dispersion. For acoustic phonons, the formalism yields the magnetic-field-dependent corrections to the longitudinal mode, while for optical phonons we identify an optical analogue of the PMCE that produces a corresponding shift in the optical branch. Together, these results provide a unified theoretical description of how band-geometric properties of Weyl fermions influence both acoustic and optical phonon dispersions in chiral Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Accurate computation of the energy variance and $\langle\langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle\rangle$ using iPEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Odd Viscoelastic Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a class of nonlinear odd viscoelastic effects in three spatial dimensions. We show that these dissipationless effects arise upon combining strains in two orthogonal directions, yielding momentum flow in the third direction. We demonstrate that the effect arises from nontrivial geometric tensors in quantum states, and can be scaled up with integer topological invariants. We further demonstrate that the effect fingerprints the multiband Hilbert-space geometry of underlying quantum states, as encoded in three-state geometric tensors. Our findings unravel the role of multistate geometry in viscoelastic phenomena, paving a path for experimental observation of uncharted nonlinear odd viscoelastic responses in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Majorana modes in graphene strips: polarization, wavefunctions, disorder, and Andreev states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have attracted intense interest due to their potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation (TQC). Graphene nanoribbons, with tunable edge terminations and compatibility with planar device architectures, offer a promising alternative to semiconductor nanowires. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of finite graphene strips with armchair, zigzag, and nearly square geometries, proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder. Using exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonian, we analyze Majorana polarization, low-energy spectra, and real-space wavefunctions to identify the non-trivial topological phases supporting MZMs and distinguish them from from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or the quasi-Majoranas. We systematically chart the robustness of these modes across geometries and disorder regimes, finding that armchair strips with short zigzag edges provide the most stable platform. Our results unify polarization diagnostics with spatial wavefunction analysis and disorder effects, yielding concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedral Core in a Sea of Competing Magnetic Phases in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the emergence of a robust tetrahedral magnetic ground state in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity (vHS). This noncoplanar, gapped spin configuration -- featuring four orthogonal moments -- has been previously identified as a candidate instability. Here, not only do we confirm its stability across all finite interactions using fully self-consistent, real-space-resolved calculations, but we also go beyond earlier work by charting the full surrounding phase diagram. In doing so, we unravel a cascade of symmetry-broken magnetic states -- pseudo-tetrahedral, planar, collinear, and modulated textures -- which we classify using spin structure factors and vector order parameters. These results stem from unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulations on large supercells with dense k-point sampling, enabling us to resolve interaction-driven magnetic and charge inhomogeneities. Our findings connect directly with recent ARPES and doping experiments near the vHS in graphene, and establish the tetrahedral state as the central correlated instability in this regime, offering predictive insight into emergent magnetism in correlated Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for the Formation of Active Sites in Single-Atom Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive dopant atoms embedded in inert host metal surfaces define the active sites in single-atom alloys (SAAs), yet SAA synthesis remains challenging. To address this, we elucidate how dopant adatoms deposited on Cu and Ag surfaces become incorporated into the metal and identify periodic trends from early to late transition metals (TMs) using density functional theory. Adatoms diffuse nearly freely across terraces, as diffusion barriers are small, whereas direct incorporation into terraces is unfavourable. In line with conventional wisdom, step edges and kink sites strongly facilitate dopant incorporation, confirming their critical role in alloy formation. Attachment of adatoms to steps and kinks from the lower terrace is favoured. Incorporation then proceeds either from this attached state or when adatoms approach a step edge from above, where reactions often proceed without barrier. Incorporation barriers are generally lower for early and central TMs, increase towards late TMs, and are slightly higher on Cu than on Ag surfaces. Repulsive interactions between Pd adatoms and dopants explain the experimental observation that a dopant-rich brim on the upper terrace of Cu surfaces inhibits incorporation from above. In contrast, attractive interactions, as found for Ru, anchor diffusing adatoms (even on terraces) and promote the formation of adatom islands, yet hinder incorporation next to the dopant and may impede the growth of embedded dopant clusters. By rationalising periodic trends and experimental observations, we show how specific surface sites and adatom--dopant interactions shape dopant incorporation, offering guidance on the surface environments most conducive to SAA synthesis for different dopant elements.</description>

      <title>Discovering topological phases in gray-Tin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($\alpha$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $\alpha$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $\alpha$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Cosserat micropolar and couple-stress elasticity models of flexomagnetism at finite deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose geometrically nonlinear (finite) continuum models of flexomagnetism based on the Cosserat micropolar and its descendent couple-stress theory. These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.</description>

Abstract: Condensed matter physics continues to seek new frustrated quantum materials that not only deepen our understanding of fundamental physical phenomena but also hold promise for transformative technologies. In this review article, we highlight the unique features of chiral spin topology and review the topological phenomena recently identified in trillium lattice compounds. Based on the unique spin states realized in these systems, we explore the potential for realizing various theoretically proposed chiral quantum phases. We examine representative materials including the magnetic insulating compound K2Ni2(SO4)3 and and the intermetallic EuPtSi discussing both experimental findings and theoretical predictions, while outlining several key questions. Finally, we offer a perspective on promising research directions aimed at uncovering novel emergent behavior in chiral trillium lattice-based materials.</description>

      <title>Correlations between superconducting and resistive anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are multiple possible origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors. For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-induced magnetic toroidal moment and nonlinear magnetoelectric effect in antiferromagnetic olivines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond conventional electric and magnetic monopoles, electric and magnetic toroidal monopoles, which are rank-0 multipoles distinguished by opposite parities under spatial inversion and time reversal, can exist in nature. The recent observation of electric-field-induced directional dichroism in antiferromagnetic olivine Co$_2$SiO$_4$ has provided the first concrete example of a magnetic toroidal monopole; however, its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here, we propose a minimal spin model that incorporates magnetoelectric coupling via the $d$-$p$ hybridization mechanism and analyze it within the mean-field approximation. The model qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and its pronounced sensitivity to the direction of the applied electric field. Furthermore, it elucidates the temperature evolution of the magnetic toroidal monopole and the strong electric-field-direction dependence of the magnetic toroidal moment. Our calculations also predict a second-order nonlinear magnetoelectric response, consistent with the symmetry classification of Co$_2$SiO$_4$ as an altermagnet. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same framework is applicable to other antiferromagnetic olivines with analogous magnetic order, indicating the robustness and generality of the toroidal-type magnetoelectric response in this material family.</description>

      <title>Characteristic ferroelectric domains and their dynamic behavior in ordered Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pb-based perovskites with multiple cations are fascinating materials showing various phenomena such as high piezoelectric, electromechanical, and relaxor properties. While chemical disordering accompanied by polar nanoregions and nanosized domains is commonly believed to cause the relaxor nature, little is known about ferroelectric microstructures of chemically ordered Pb-based perovskites. In this study, we discovered intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains in chemically ordered ferroelectric Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$ using in-situ transmission electron microscopy with dark-field imaging. Observation results demonstrate that electric polarization can fluctuate around the [111] direction despite the formation of long-range ordered rhombohedral domains, which results in unique weak relaxor properties. In-situ imaging upon heating successfully reveals the dynamic behavior of domain-wall movements with lattice distortion and paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition. Our research provides new insights into the effect of chemical ordering on ferroelectric nanodomains.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Metastability and Structural Diversity of Hopfions in Chiral Magnetic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological particle-like excitations such as skyrmions and hopfions offer rich opportunities for spintronic and photonic applications. While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Mechanical Property Prediction across Material Classes using Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Universal Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of six universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for predicting the temperature and pressure response of materials by molecular dynamics simulations. Accuracy is evaluated across 13 diverse materials (nine metal-organic frameworks and four inorganic compounds), computing bulk modulus, thermal expansion, and thermal decomposition. These MLIPs employ three different architectures (graph neural networks, graph network simulators, and graph transformers) with varying training datasets. We observe qualitative accuracy across these predictions but systematic underestimation of bulk modulus and overestimation of thermal expansion across all models, consistent with potential energy surface softening. From all tested models, three top performers arise; `MACE-MP-0a', `fairchem_OMAT', and `Orb-v3', with average error across metrics and materials of 41%, 44%, and 47%, respectively. Despite strong overall performance, questions arise about the limits of model transferability: dataset homogeneity and structural representation dominate model accuracy. Our results show that certain architectures can compensate for biases, a step closer to truly universal MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Order-Disorder in Fe-Si Alloys: Implications for Seismic Anisotropy and Thermal Evolution of Earth's Inner Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of Earth's inner core is essential for constraining its composition, thermal evolution, and seismic properties. Silicon is a probable major component of Earth's core. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic modeling, we investigate the structural, elastic, and transport properties of Fe-Si alloys at high pressures and temperatures. By computing the Gibbs free energies of B2, hcp, fcc, and bcc solid solutions, we construct the Fe-Si phase diagram applicable to the Earth's inner core. Our results reveal a pronounced miscibility gap between hcp and B2 Fe-Si, with the two phases coexisting over the compositional range of 6-11 wt% Si at 6000 K. The B2 Fe-Si alloy exhibits strong single-crystal shear anisotropy (22.9% at 6000 K) compared to the nearly isotropic hcp phase (0.6%), and yields a shear wave velocity (3.73 km/s) and Poisson's ratio consistent with seismological observations. Moreover, the computed transport properties reveal substantially lower thermal conductivity of B2 Fe-Si relative to pure iron or hcp Fe-Si under inner-core conditions. These results imply that Earth's inner core likely comprises multiple phases, whose distribution and crystallographic texture critically influence its seismic and thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Development of ultra-high efficiency soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy equipped with deep prior-based denoising method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) is one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques to visualize the three-dimensional bulk electronic structure in reciprocal lattice space. Compared with ARPES employing low-energy photon sources, the time burden imposed by a lower photoelectron yield, stemming from the photoionization cross-section, has been a persistent technical challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES ({\mu}SX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds. We demonstrate, through the {\mu}SX-ARPES measurements on a single crystal of CeRu2Si2, that data with sufficient statistical accuracy can be obtained in approximately 40 seconds. In addition, we present the potential of high signal-to-noise ratio ARPES measurement, achieving an energy resolution of 51.6 meV at an excitation energy of 708 eV in {\mu}SX-ARPES measurements on polycrystalline gold. Our developed system successfully reduces the time burden in SX-ARPES and paves the way for advancements in lower photoelectron yield measurements, such as those requiring higher energy resolution and three-dimensional nonequilibrium measurements.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultra-Broadband Frequency Comb in Strongly Bistable Nonlinear Magnonic Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) offer a promising route to compact, energy-efficient platforms for on-chip coherent microwave signal generation and processing. Conventional on-chip comb generation typically relies on nonlinear resonators supporting a series of equidistant, low-loss resonances driven by a strong monochromatic signal, resulting in fixed comb spacing defined by the resonator's free spectral range (FSR). Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for ultrabroadband MFC generation using a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator. The small resonator volume, combined with a slow-wave transducer, yields high intra-resonator power density, driving the system deep into the bistable regime where parametric excitation of propagating spin waves facilitates comb formation. Our approach yields more than 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth, with spacing continuously tunable via a two-tone external drive, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at relatively low power. The platform is ultra-compact (4-6 orders of magnitude smaller in size than conventional YIG sphere resonators), fully scalable, and highly tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties through magnetic bias and pump manipulation. These results establish a new paradigm for frequency comb technology, unlocking transformative opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.</description>

      <title>Imaging propagating terahertz collective modes in two-dimensional semiconductor double layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors exhibit a wide range of novel phenomena at millielectronvolt (terahertz-frequency) energy scales, including superconducting and correlation-induced insulating gaps that are frequently accompanied by symmetry breaking. However, due to the subwavelength dimensions and the often low conductivities of these systems, their intrinsic THz plasmons and meV-scale excitation gaps are difficult to access experimentally. Here we report an optical readout method that can image propagating THz-frequency collective modes in real time. The method relies on a strong coupling between the optical polarons of monolayer TMD semiconductors and the local THz fields in a waveguide, which enables us to image THz plasmons with micron scale spatial resolution and determine their propagation group velocities. Moreover, at finite magnetic fields, we observe coherent cyclotron oscillations resulting from Landau level repopulation induced by the THz field. Our findings provide a new near-field platform for probing collective excitations in strongly correlated two-dimensional semiconductors and enable "all-photonic" TMD-based architectures for time-domain THz plasmonics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Chern Insulator at Zero Electric Field in ABCB-Stacked Tetralayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of near-EF van Hove singularity and in-gap topological Dirac surface states in superconducting electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting electrides have attracted growing attention for their potential to achieve high superconducting transition temperatures (TC) under pressure. However, many known electrides are chemically reactive and unstable, making high-quality single-crystal growth, characterization, and measurements difficult, and most do not exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. In contrast, La3In stands out for its ambient-pressure superconductivity (TC ~ 9.4 K) and the availability of high-quality single crystals. Here, we investigate its low-energy electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals. A saddle point is directly observed at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary, while a three-dimensional van Hove singularity crosses EF at the BZ corner. First-principles calculations further reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap above EF. The coexistence of a high density of states and in-gap topological surface states near EF suggests that La3In offers a promising platform for tuning superconductivity and exploring possible topological superconducting phases through doping or external pressure.</description>

      <title>Observing the spatial and temporal evolution of exciton wave functions in organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, the correlated electron-hole pairs governing optical and transport properties in organic semiconductors, have long resisted direct experimental access to their full quantum-mechanical wave functions. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved photoemission orbital tomography (trPOT), combining high-harmonic probe pulses with time- and momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, to directly image the momentum-space distribution and ultrafast dynamics of excitons in $\alpha$-sexithiophene thin films. We introduce a quantitative model that enables reconstruction of the exciton wave function in real space, including both its spatial extent and its internal phase structure. The reconstructed wave function reveals coherent delocalization across approximately three molecular units and exhibits a characteristic phase modulation, consistent with ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory. Time-resolved measurements further show a $\sim 20$\% contraction of the exciton radius within 400 fs, providing direct evidence of self-trapping driven by exciton-phonon coupling. These results establish trPOT as a general and experimentally accessible approach for resolving exciton wave functions -- with spatial, phase, and temporal sensitivity -- in a broad class of molecular and low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>CsCl seed layer homogenizes co-evaporated perovskite growth for high-efficiency fully textured perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells experienced a significant increase in efficiency, making them viable for industrial applications. Among the various scalable and industry-compatible metal halide perovskite deposition techniques, co-evaporation stands out as particularly well-suited for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells due to its ability to conformally cover textured silicon bottom cells. Solution-processed [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz) is commonly used as a hole-transporting material for co-evaporated metal halide perovskites. However, we show that it covers the textured surface of silicon bottom cells unevenly, impacting the film growth and leading to the formation of residual PbI2 at the buried interface. The present study reveals via X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) that a CsCl seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation across the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface, even in the areas with a thin MeO-2PACz layer, thereby preventing the formation of interfacial PbI2 and leading to larger apparent grains. The improvement of the metal halide perovskite film quality on the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface and the bulk perovskite film led to 30.3% (29.7% certified) efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. The present work highlights the importance of a seed layer for a robust growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite and represents an important milestone for the transfer of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells from laboratory to industry.</description>

      <title>Radial etching of strongly confined crystal-phase defined quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize strongly confined quantum dots (QDs) in InAs nanowires (NWs) by combining epitaxial crystal-phase control with chemical wet etching. A strong axial confinement is first introduced by growing closely spaced wurtzite (WZ) tunnel barriers in NWs to enclose a zinc blende (ZB) QD. The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy &gt; 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control.</description>

      <title>Controlling Knot Topology in Magnetic Hopfions via Spin-orbit Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knots, characterized by topological invariants called the Hopf number $H$, arise from the intertwining of strings and exhibit diverse configurations. The knot structures have recently been observed in condensed matters, as examplified by a magnetic hopfion, sparking interest in controlling their topology. Here, we show that spin-orbit torque (SOT) enables dynamic manipulation of the Hopf number of magnetic hopfions. We investigate the SOT-driven evolution of hopfions, revealing the splitting of a high-$H$ hopfion into multiple lower-$H$ ones, a process that can be quantified by an effective tension picture. Comparative analysis across different $H$ uncovers a hierarchy of instabilities that dictates these dynamical topological transitions. These findings establish SOT as a powerful tool for controlling hopfion topology, paving the way for potential applications in topological memory devices.</description>

Here, we investigate the layered family (PA)$_2$CsY$_2$X$_7$ (Y = Pb, Sn; X = I, Br) using density functional theory, Berry-phase polarization analysis, and effective $\boldsymbol{k \cdot p}$ modeling. Across all four members, we find indirect bandgaps with extrema near $\Gamma$, sizable spin splittings at both band edges, and robust in-plane ferroelectric polarization that stabilizes out-of-plane persistent spin textures (PSTs). Crucially, polarization reversal switches the spin orientation, enabling electrical control of PSTs and thereby non-volatile manipulation of spin states. These results establish (PA)$_2$CsY$_2$X$_7$ as a versatile materials platform where compositional design and ferroelectric switching jointly enable spintronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics of magnetic hopfions driven by spin-orbit torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopfions--three-dimensional topological solitons with knotted spin texture--have recently garnered attention in topological magnetism due to their unique topology characterized by the Hopf number $H$, a topological invariant derived from knot theory. In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions. These results demonstrate the controllability of hopfion topology via SOT and suggest a pathway toward multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching.</description>

      <title>Rapid Determination of Nanodiamond Size Distribution and Impurity Concentration from Raman Spectra Using an Open Machine-Learning Toolbox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ready-to-use numerical toolbox for nanodiamond Raman spectra calculation and fit is presented. The developed theoretical approach allows accounting for arbitrary nanoparticle size-distribution and the microscopic line broadening mechanisms for the optical phonons. The two tools for solving the inverse problem of the nanodiamond properties reconstruction using a known Raman spectrum are provided. The first one utilizes a dense neural network trained on a vast array of synthetic Raman spectra. The second approach is based on the stochastic Metropolis algorithm, which updates the ensemble parameters by small quantities, tending to the state with minimal error. Both methods are available thanks to the computationally instant elasticity theory-like model for optical phonon modes in diamond nanocrystals that accurately reproduces the results of the atomistic approaches. Using experimental Raman spectra for nanodiamonds prepared by various techniques, we tested our tools and observed a faithful agreement with the data as well as between the two methods. The open and documented software is accessible online (nanoraman.pythonanywhere.com) and as a Python module (github.com/KoniakhinSV/Nanoparticle_Raman).</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric topology: the rope weaving in parameter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology, as a mathematical concept, has been introduced into condensed matter physics since the discovery of quantum Hall effect, which characterizes new physical scenario beyond the Landau theory. The topologically protected physical quantities, such as the dissipationless quantum transport of edge/surface states as well as magnetic/dipole quasi-particles like skyrmions/bimerons, have attracted great research enthusiasms in the past decades. In recent years, another kind of topology in condensed matter was revealed in the magnetoelectric parameter space of multiferroics, which deepens our understanding of magnetoelectric physics. This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft. These exotic topological magnetoelectric behaviors may be helpful to pursuit energy-efficient and precise-control devices for spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable spin-resolved subbands in multilayer WSe2 probed by quantum point contact spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides provide a platform for exploring spin-valley physics, offering a promising approach to electric-field-driven spin control for low-power spintronic and quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced spin splitting in the Q and Q' valleys of multilayer n-type WSe2 using quantum-point-contact spectroscopy. Systematic modulations in four distinct conductance quantization steps, providing direct evidence of spin-valley-layer coupling-driven spin-resolved density of states, were achieved by tuning the out-of-plane gate voltage. Notably, the electric-field-induced spin splitting significantly dominated the magnetic-field-induced Zeeman effect (e.g., ~ 6 meV for a displacement field change of ~ 0.04 V/nm vs. ~ 1 meV for a magnetic field of 9 T), demonstrating a powerful, non-magnetic manipulation of spin states. This ability to manipulate spin states by gate voltage is crucial for advancing next-generation low-power spintronic and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>A cascade model for the defect-driven etching of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) via the selective electrochemical etching (ECE) of conductive Si-doped layers, separated by non-intentionally doped (NID) layers, provides a straightforward methodology for producing highly reflective DBRs suitable for device overgrowth and integration, which has otherwise proven difficult in the III-nitride epitaxial system via conventional alloying. Such photonic materials can be fabricated by a lithography-free defect-driven etching process, where threading dislocations intrinsic to heteroepitaxy form nanoscale channels that facilitate etchant transport through NID layers. Here, we report the first three-dimensional characterisation of porous GaN-on-Si DBRs fabricated in this methodology with different ECE voltages, using serial-section tomography in a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). These datasets reconstruct the pore morphology as etching proliferates through the alternating Si-doped/NID layer stack. Volumetric reconstruction enabled us to enhance the established `kebab' model for defect-driven etching by proposing a `cascade' model where etchant cascades through the material via vertical etching down nanopipes and horizontal etching across pores, forming complex networks directly related to the pathways taken. This accounts for premature nanopipe termination and discontinuities in nanopipe formation, where dislocations are observed to activate and deactivate individually. Statistical analysis of individual etching behaviour, across all dislocations for each tomograph, revealed a greater tendency to form continuous structures that follow conventional kebab behaviour at higher ECE voltages. We propose that higher ECE voltages alter the probability of dislocation etching relative to doped layer etching, thereby empowering morphological optimization through improved mechanistic understanding of ECE.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced frequency shift in semiconductor spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.</description>

      <title>Trion gas on the surface of a failed excitonic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trions, three-body bound states composed of an exciton and an additional charge, are typically fragile and require external excitation to form. Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of the layered semiconductor Ta2NiS5, revealed through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory. Instead, we argue that it arises from the formation of negative trions, stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Unlike excitons, these trions form without optical pumping and persist at equilibrium, marking a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a nominally conventional semiconductor. Our findings establish Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for exploring many-body physics at surfaces and open new avenues for studying and controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</description>

      <title>Reservoir neuromorphic computing based on spin-orbit coupling in an organic crystal resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is at the basis of the recent progress in artificial intelligence. But the progress is accompanied with increasing demands in computational resources and power supply. Reservoir neuromorphic computing uses a non-linear physical system to replace a part of a large neural network. The advantages can include reduced power consumption and faster learning. We show that the interference in an organic crystal waveguide resonator leads to efficient separation of optical patterns, allowing a significant reduction of the size of the neural network and an acceleration of the learning process. For more complex symbols, extending the reservoir output dimension thanks to spin-orbit coupling, we achieve a 10-times reduction of the network size and a 3-fold speedup. Our work suggests a general path for the performance improvement of photonic reservoir computing systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Dynamical Correlations in Antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure and dynamical correlations in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, a prototypical room-temperature multiferroic, using a variety of static and dynamical first-principles methods. Conventional static Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$, DFT+$U$+$V$) incorrectly predict a deep-valence Fe $3d$ peak (around $-7\,\text{eV}$) in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, in contradiction with hard-X-ray photoemission. We resolve this failure by using a recent generalization of DFT+$U$ to include a frequency-dependent screening -- DFT+$U(\omega)$ -- or using a dynamical Hubbard functional (dynH). The screened Coulomb interaction $U(\omega)$, computed with spin-polarized RPA and projected onto maximally localized Fe $3d$ Wannier orbitals, is expressed as a sum-over-poles, yielding a self-energy that augments the Kohn--Sham Hamiltonian. This DFT+$U(\omega)$ approach predicts a fundamental band gap of $1.53\,\text{eV}$, consistent with experiments, and completely eliminates the unphysical deep-valence peak. The resulting simulated HAXPES spectrum reproduces the experimental lineshape with an accuracy matching or exceeding that of far more demanding DFT+DMFT calculations. Our work demonstrates the critical nature of dynamical screening in complex oxides and establishes DFT+$U(\omega)$ as a predictive, computationally efficient method for correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: We consider a quantum ring placed in a gyrotropic cavity characterized by the energy splitting between the left and right circularly polarized modes. We show that despite the absence of constant magnetic field penetrating through the ring, in the regime of the ultrastrong light matter coupling, the total current in the ground state changes discontinuously with the light matter coupling in the direct analogy with the Aharonov-Bohm ring. We consider the driven-dissipative of the system and show that the discontinuous change of the total angular momentum can be directly probed via the spectral and statical properties of the radiation emitted by the system under weak coherent drive.</description>

      <title>Compact localized currents in flat bands with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice Hamiltonians that explicitly break time-reversal symmetry (TRS). By threading magnetic flux through disconnected polygonal plaquettes and applying local entangling unitary transformations, we map plaquettes onto families of ABF models in one, two, and three dimensions. This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations. In these TRS-broken constructions, the CLSs host localized circulatory currents whose magnitude depends on the applied flux. We further extend the framework to lattices with coexisting flat and dispersive bands, illustrating cases with both orthogonal and non-orthogonal CLSs. Our results provide a controlled route for generating dispersionless lattices supporting flux-induced local currents.</description>

      <title>Controlling Dissipative Topology Through Floquet Driving: From Transient Diagnostics to Boundary States Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying surfactant adsorption at fluid interfaces by combining X-ray reflection and simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adsorption of surfactants to fluid interfaces occurs in daily-life and technological contexts like dish washing and oil spill remediation. The surfactant surface coverage $\Gamma$ governs interface characteristics like tension $\gamma$, viscoelastic properties, and the stability of thin foam films. Directly measuring $\Gamma$ as a function of the bulk concentration $c$ is highly desirable but challenging, particularly for non-ionic surfactants that lack easily detectable labels. Here, we propose a generic approach to deduce the adsorption isotherm $\Gamma(c)$: As a first step, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of surfactant-loaded air/water interfaces with known $\Gamma$ to obtain interfacial electron density profiles. From these profiles, we then compute theoretical X-ray reflectivity curves, which we compare with experimental measurements to find the matching $c$. We focus on two non-ionic surfactants (C$_{12}$EO$_6$} and $\beta$-C$_{12}$G$_2$}) with previously verified force fields to demonstrate how this combined approach of experiments and simulations can determine the adsorption isotherm. By using the equation of state $\gamma(\Gamma)$ from simulations, our results replicate the measured surface tension isotherms $\gamma(c)$.</description>

      <title>Exchange interaction in gate-defined quantum dots beyond the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative description of the exchange interaction in quantum dots is relevant for modeling gate operations of spin qubits. By measuring the amplitude and frequency of exchange-driven qubit state oscillations, we measure the detuning dependence of the exchange coupling in a GaAs double quantum dot over three orders of magnitude. Both 1D and 3D full configuration interaction simulations can replicate the observed behavior. Extending a Hubbard model by including excited states increases the range of detuning where it provides a good fit, thus elucidating the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Dual topology and edge-reconstruction in $\alpha$-Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the tight-binding model for cubic $\alpha$-Sn based on the DFT calculations. In the model, we incorporate a variable bond angle, which allows us to simulate the effect of the in-plane strain. In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $\alpha$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $\alpha$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-induced magnetization reversal in a ferromagnetic film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that moving edge dislocations can induce the reversal of magnetization in a ferromagnetic film due to the Barnett effect. The dynamics of magnetization is studied numerically within a discretized Landau-Lifshitz equation on a hexagonal lattice containing over $10^5$ sites. Local coordinate frames coupled to the crystallographic axes for each spin are used together with the laboratory coordinate frame. The parameters of a hexagonal close-packed cobalt lattice have been chosen for illustration. The magnetization reversal from a metastable initial state created by the external magnetic field occurs on a time scale of a few picoseconds. Our results imply that fast local elastic twists generated by moving dislocations serve as an important mechanism of magnetization dynamics in solids subjected to a mechanical stress.</description>

      <title>Coherent subgap transport in spin-split Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of subgap transport in ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor/insulator/superconductor junctions realized in EuS/Al/AlOx/Al vertical stacks. Differential conductance measurements reveal multiple Andreev reflection peaks, with odd-order peaks split by the spin-splitting induced in the superconductor adjacent to EuS, while even-order peaks remain unaffected. Combining experiments with quasiclassical transport modeling, we extract the spin-splitting and the distribution of transmission channels, finding that a significant fraction ($\sim 23\%$) of highly transparent channels ($\tau \approx 0.9$) dominates transport. The observation of a Josephson current further confirms strong superconducting coupling through these channels. Our results demonstrate that a single spin-split superconductor is sufficient to observe the even-odd MAR effect. Our work establishes EuS/Al junctions as a versatile platform to study subgap transport, Josephson coupling, and spin-polarized superconducting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Response regimes in on-chip THz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.</description>

      <title>Wilson loops, symmetries, and selective bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in a family of chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians. These models generalize the $\pi$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic pumping of topological corner states by coherent tunneling in a 2D SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The active manipulation of topologically protected states represents a pivotal frontier for quantum technologies, offering a unique confluence of topological robustness and precise quantum control. We propose an adiabatic pumping scheme for the long-range transfer of topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The protocol utilizes a modular lattice architecture composed of four topologically distinct subblocks, enabling the modulation of a topological dark state by precise tuning of lattice couplings. This approach is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. We establish a multi-level model for the adiabatic pumping that provides an accurate description of the underlying mechanism. In comparison with a sequential two-stage Thouless pumping, our protocol offers superior performance in both transfer fidelity and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new component for the accurate simulation of neutron scattering from magnetic excitations has been developed for the neutron ray-tracing software McStas. The component SpinWave_BCO simulates inelastic neutron scattering from ferro-, antiferro-, and altermagnetic excitations in a body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure, where the dispersion relation and scattered neutron intensities are derived using linear spin wave theory.
  Data from a simulated Triple-Axis Spectrometer with an extremely high resolution have been verified by direct comparison with theory and by comparison to data simulated using the package SpinW. The component serves as a proof-of-concept for the implementation of a more general linear spin wave component in McStas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years tantalizing signs for a novel phase have been reported that is chirally symmetric but nevertheless exhibits massive bound states. The necessary condition for such a phase, referred to as Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG), is the cancellation of all (continuous and discrete) 't~Hooft anomalies. In 3+1 dimensions this occurs in systems containing a multiple of 16 massless Weyl fermions. SMG was originally discovered in lower dimensional condensed matter systems. We present results investigating four dimensional field theories with gauge group SU(3). Our findings suggest that SU(3) with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions exhibits an SMG phase not only on the lattice but also in the infinite cutoff continuum limit. If confirmed, SMG could provide a new UV completion of the standard model and give rise to new scenarios for beyond standard model physics.</description>

Abstract: We review the theoretical description of the role of quantum geometry in superfluidity and superconductivity of multiband systems, with focus on flat bands where quantum geometry is wholly responsible for supercurrents. This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ through a two-stage chemical vapor transport method. The Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ system is a member of the orthorhombic $Pbam$ (No. 55) space group and realizes a distorted trigonal tricapped prism (TTP) crystal field around each cerium site. We characterized the sample through orientation-dependent magnetization and heat capacity measurements to probe the magnetic anisotropy in the system characteristic of XY-like anisotropic Heisenberg model behavior. Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ furthermore enters a zero-field ordered phase under $T_N =$ 2.4 K; powder neutron diffraction measurements reveal incommensurate magnetic order near $T_N$. The system then locks into a commensurate, two-$q$ magnetic structure below approximately 1.2 K. This commensurate structure belongs to the Shubnikov group $Pb'a'm'$ (MSG 55.359) and realizes the propagation vectors $\vec{q} = (1/3,0,0)$ and $\vec{q} = (0,0,0)$.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have observed superconductivity proximate to the nu = -2/3 fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator in twisted MoTe2. A critical open question is whether the underlying normal state is a Fermi liquid with a large Fermi surface or a strongly correlated metal with low carrier density. In this work, we develop a theory of the phases emerging from doping the $\nu = -2/3$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI). We establish a duality between this problem and doping a gapped SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid (CSL).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining symmetry analysis and direct density functional calculations including the spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that anomalous Hall effect can be observed in not only germanides with general formula RMn$_2$Ge$_2$, where $R$ is a rare-earth ion or Y. Our calculations predict a large anomalous Hall conductivity in LaMn$_2$Si$_2$, with a non-zero $\sigma_{xy}^{AH}$ component of $-360~\text{S/cm}$, accompanied by a pronounced magneto-optical response. Remarkably, electron doping of LaMn$_2$Si$_2$ is expected to substantially enhance the Hall conductivity, with values reaching up to -650 S/cm. These results suggest that silicides with general formula RM$_2$Si$_2$ can be an interesting platform for studying anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding operation of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by an exotic nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with or without the aid of a controlled defect. The topological zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</description>

      <title>Gauge flux generations of weakly magnetized Dirac spin liquid in a kagom\'{e} lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent progress on the Dirac spin liquid and the kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the U(1) Dirac spin liquid on the kagom\'{e} lattice and consider the response of this quantum state to the weak magnetic field by examining the matter-gauge coupling. Even though the system is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms. The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</description>

      <title>Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional s-wave superconductivity in regular 3D (or 2D) metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in 'practical' SC that can in principle be observed in experiments, so the $T=0$ ground state being SC is not of interest, or for that matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also not of interest in the current work. We discuss both 2D and 3D cases, focusing mostly on the 3D case. We find that almost any theory based on the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K for s-wave SC in all metals (including the alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales are all $&gt;10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the Eliashberg gap equations we find that the $T_c$ of the 3D (or 2D) electron gas can be reduced well below $\sim1$ K depending on choices of frequency cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the one discovered 60 years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-s-wave SC arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially low $T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg theories and different screening models to make our point.</description>

      <title>Embedding independent length scale of flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In flat-band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat-band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding independent characterization of interacting flat-band materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and reshape a material's spatial symmetry. Because the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is exquisitely sensitive to symmetry, it offers a natural arena for magnetic-field control. Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Crystalline Materials with Record Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity via a Universal Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralow glass-like lattice thermal conductivity in crystalline materials is crucial for enhancing energy conversion efficiency in thermoelectrics and thermal insulators. We introduce a universal descriptor for thermal conductivity that relies only on the atomic number in the primitive cell and the sound velocity, enabling fast and scalable materials screening. Coupled with high-throughput workflows and universal machine learning potentials, we identify the candidate materials with ultralow thermal conductivity from over 25, 000 materials. We further validate this approach by experimentally confirming record-low thermal conductivity values of 0.15-0.16 W/m/K from 170 to 400 K in the halide metal CsAg2I3. Combining inelastic neutron scattering with first-principles calculations, we attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the intrinsically small sound velocity, strong anharmonicity, and structural complexity. Our work illustrates how a universal descriptor, combined with high-throughput screening, machine-learning potential and experiment, enables the efficient discovery of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the system can exchange symmetry charge with the environment but still preserve symmetry at the ensemble level. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We illustrate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical geometric tensor in multiparameter quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrepancy between quantum distinguishability in Hilbert space and classical distinguishability in probability space is expressed by the gap between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices (QFIM and CFIM, respectively). This intrinsic quantum obstruction is generally not saturable and plays a central role in both fundamental insights and practical applications in modern quantum physics. Here, we develop a geometrical framework for this gap by introducing the notion of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We relate this quantity to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part equals the QFIM. We prove the matrix inequality between QGT and SCGT, which sharpens the standard inequality between QFIM and CFIM and provides novel multiparameter information bounds: the real part of the SCGT reproduces the CFIM plus an additional nonnegative contribution capturing quantum obstruction. This further motivates a natural extension of the Berry phase to the semi-classical setting.</description>

      <title>Reflection positivity and a refined index for 2d invertible phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the validity of reflection positivity in the classification of invertible phases of quantum spin systems. We provide a mathematical model in which every 2d invertible state admits a reflection-positive representative. We prove that reflection positivity provides a canonical lift from the set of invertible phases to the set of invertible phases protected by a $\mathbb{Z}/N$-rotational symmetry. Using this, we define a refined version of the index recently introduced by the author. This refined version conjecturally provides a microscopic characterization of an invariant that coincides with the chiral central charge $c_-$ when conformal field theory effectively describes the boundary modes.</description>
