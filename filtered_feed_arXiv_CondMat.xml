      <title>Pair density wave in the fractional quantum Hall effect at even denominator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling 5/2, which is usually understood as a $p$-wave paired state of underlying quasiparticles - composite fermions, transforms into a nematic phase under pressure \cite{csathy0, csathy}. A pair density wave (PDW) may be a precursor, underlying state for this behaviour, and such state(s) were proposed that maintain the weak-pairing feature of the uniform paired state \cite{frad}. Based on considerations in the weak-coupling regime of a microscopic description of the pairing phase (to mimic the phase as it gives way to a nematic phase in the experiments), we argue that the ensuing and relevant PDW state has a strong-pairing character. Furthermore, due to the existence of a single collective mode associated with the order parameter in the uniform paired phase, in the weak-coupling regime, the $p$-wave paired state, in general (for example, in the superconducting state of electrons), may be prone to a PDW instability.</description>

      <title>Imaging Quantum Well States of Dirac Electrons in Exfoliated 3D Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a controlled mechanical exfoliation technique for bulk 3D topological insulators that yields atomically clean ultrathin flakes, enabling quantum well states (QWS) of Dirac electrons to be clearly resolved. Achieving reliable fabrication of pristine, high-quality two-dimensional layers suitable for atomic-scale spectroscopy remains a central experimental challenge in uncovering their emergent quantum states and realizing device-relevant functionalities. Atomically resolved scanning probe microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy reveal a strong correlation between Raman intensity and film thickness, enabling rapid identification of (Bi\textsubscript{0.1}Sb\textsubscript{0.9})\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{3} flakes with desired thickness. High resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy on exfoliated flakes with atomically flat terraces reveals QWS, driven by quantum confinement of Dirac electrons. This effect is rarely observed due to the electrons resistance to electrostatic confinement caused by Klein tunneling. The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy around surface defects further confirms that QWS of Dirac electrons in topological insulators remains robust against defect scattering. This work paves the way for exploring diverse quantum phenomena and device applications through quantum confinement, surface-state engineering, and tunable topological phases.</description>

      <title>Topological BF Theory construction of twisted dihedral quantum double phases from spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</description>

      <title>Topological surface-state destruction via trivializing proximity effect: Lattice localization despite continuum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a significant conceptual revision to the tenfold classification scheme for topological insulators and superconductors, it was recently demonstrated that most three-dimensional (3D) classes are simultaneously "localizable" in two distinct, but intricately connected ways: (1) There is no obstruction to Wannier localization of all bulk eigenstates, and (2) Almost all surface states can be Anderson localized by arbitrarily weak symmetry-preserving quenched disorder. Here we consider the localizable class CI in 3D, and numerically investigate the stability of surface states. We demonstrate that surface states of a bulk class-CI topological lattice model are fragile in that they can be Anderson localized by the combination of weak quenched randomness and hybridization with an additional trivial 2D band (a trivializing proximity effect, TPE). With the TPE, stronger disorder is more destructive to the surface states of the bulk lattice model. By contrast, without additional bands the surface states remain extended, exhibiting robust spectrum-wide quantum criticality. We also investigate the fragility of surface states in effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene. Although the continuum models exhibit signs of Anderson localization near gap edges for weak disorder, stronger disorder instead appears to heal the surface, restoring criticality whilst filling in spectral energy gaps. Our results provide further evidence that effective continuum field theories fail to capture key aspects of surface-state physics in localizable topological phases.</description>

      <title>Hidden Magnon Berry Curvature drives Vertical Magnon Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict an in-plane, or hidden, Berry curvature (BC) for magnons in electrically insulating quasi-2D magnets and demonstrate that the hidden magnon Berry curvature (HMBC) gives rise to a previously unrecognized form of vertical, out-of-plane, magnon transport. Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${{\cal Z}}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry. Both systems exhibit distinctive features across a broad range of temperatures and parameters. Therefore, our prediction of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly testable in present-day magnonic experiments, especially in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Cyclic structure of Landau levels in transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unconventional Landau level (LL) spectra that cannot be fully captured by an effective mass approximation or a minimal two-band Dirac model. Namely, TMDs show an anomalous, upward-sloping zeroth LL in the valence band and an asymmetric orbital magnetization between electron and hole bands. In this paper, we employ a continuum three-band model to derive analytic constraints on the LL spectrum of the $K$ and $K'$ valleys at weak magnetic fields. This model highlights the cyclic structure of the LL spectrum inherited from $C_3$ symmetry, providing both analytical tractability and an accurate description of the band geometry in the low energy approximation of the valleys. We compare our results against numerical calculations using the three-band tight-binding model of Ref.[1] and a distorted kagome lattice model. We find that the Landau levels of the $K$ and $K'$ valleys show a cyclic structure which explains their anomalous slope and magnetization asymmetry. This asymmetry can be traced to the topological obstruction of TMD semiconductors. We further analyze the impact of disorder, finding that the zeroth LL exhibits partial robustness against certain off-diagonal perturbations, in contrast to the exact index-theorem protection of massive Dirac particles. Our results establish a direct link between orbital structure, band topology, and magnetic response in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Plasmon polariton assisted second-harmonic generation in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a theoretical examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a graphene monolayer integrated within an attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) configuration. By embedding graphene in this optical setup, we explore the enhancement in the nonlinear optical response, particularly focusing on the efficiency of SHG. Our analysis reveals that the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) plays a central role in significantly boosting the efficiency of SHG. The unique electronic properties of graphene, combined with the resonant characteristics of SPPs, create a synergistic effect that amplifies the nonlinear optical signals. This enhancement is attributed to the strong field confinement and the resonant nature of SPPs, which effectively increase the interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer. Furthermore, we analyze the underlying mechanisms that govern this process, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates the interplay between graphene's electronic structure and the optical fields. Our findings suggest that the ATR scheme not only facilitates the excitation of SPPs but also optimizes the conditions for SHG.</description>

      <title>Limitations on Activation of High Dose Ge implant in beta-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among ultrawide bandgap semiconductors, beta-Ga2O3 is particularly promising for high power and frequency applications. For devices, n-type concentrations above 10^19 cm^-3 are required. Ge is a promising alternative n-type dopant with an ionic radius similar to Ga. Homoepitaxial 010 beta-Ga2O3 films were implanted with Ge to form 50 and 100 nm box concentration of 3*10^19 cm^-3 and 5*10^19 cm^-3, with damage ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 displacement per atom. For lower damage implants, optimized anneals in ultrahigh purity N2 at 950-1000 C for 5-10 minutes resulted in Rs of 600-700 omega/sqr, mobilities of 60-70 cm^2/Vs, and Ge activation of up to 40%. For higher damage implants, activation dropped to 23% with similar mobilities. Ge diffusion, measured by second ion mass spectrometry, showed formation of a Ge "clustering peak" with a concentration exceeding the initial implant following anneals in N2 or O2 at 950-1000 C. Beyond this peak, minimal Ge diffusion occurred for N2 anneals at 950 C, but at 1050 C non-Fickian diffusion extended to &gt;200 nm. Electrical activation data suggests that clustered Ge is electrically inactive. To understand Ge clustering, several samples were characterized by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Second-phase precipitates were observed in as-implanted samples which then fully dissoved after furnace annealing in N2 at 1050 C. Diffraction peaks suggest these implant-induced precipitates may be related to a high pressure Pa-3 phase of GeO2, and may evolve during anneals to explain the Ge clustering. Ultimately, we believe Ge clustering limits activation of implanted Ge at high concentrations.</description>

      <title>Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration to Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic orbitals underpin our understanding of electronic structure, providing intuitive descriptions of bonding, charge transfer, magnetism, and correlation effects. Despite their utility, an atomic basis that is adaptable, strictly localized on atomic centers, and enables accurate tight-binding interpolation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals (COGITO), a framework that constructs an optimal atomic orbital basis by identifying and resolving key mathematical obstacles inherent to nonorthogonal bases--particularly uncontrolled orbital mixing, and the fixed-overlap constraint between orbitals. We demonstrate that COGITO enables tight-binding models as accurate as MLWF-based approaches, while preserving the ability of tight-binding parameters to represent the projected atomic basis--an essential feature lost in schemes that enforce orbital orthogonality or maximal localization. By creating accurate and chemically interpretable models of electronic structure, COGITO reveals the orbital-resolved covalent bonds and charge transfer that is encoded in the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of DFT. Our method thus offers a powerful tool for any physics- or chemistry-based application that relies on a faithful description of local electronic structure.</description>

      <title>An activation-relaxation technique study of two-level system impact on internal dissipation using DFT-based moment tensor potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a recently-developed machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) trained on data generated with the density functional theory (DFT) and tailored to amorphous silicon coupled with the Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to identify and classify two-level systems (TLS). The samples generated using MTP recover experimental results and provide average structural and dissipative properties similar to those obtained with a modified Stillinger-Weber potential, including radial distribution function, defect concentration and internal friction. Atomistic details, however, are significantly different, including the density and type of TLS. In particular, we find that while the density of TLS involving a bond-hopping mechanism is similar for the two potentials, more complex TLSs, such as those involving a Wooten-Winer-Weaire bond exchange, are about twice as common. Analysis also shows that TLSs, for MTP-based models, are mostly isolated and oscillate independently from each other.</description>

      <title>A Full Minimal Coupling GW-BSE Framework for Circular Dichroism in Solids: Applications to Chiral 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD) and other chiroptical responses are a key probe of both chirality and momentum-space geometry in solids, but first-principles calculations are still challenging in periodic systems with strong exciton effects. Here, we develop a gauge-invariant first-principles framework for CD including exciton effects based on full minimal coupling (FMC) within the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism. In contrast to standard multipole expansion and sum-over-states (SOS) approaches, which require careful gauge-fixing, converge slowly, and suffer origin ambiguities, FMC evaluates optical matrix elements directly at finite photon wavevector, naturally including intraband and near-degenerate transitions while placing electric-dipole (ED), magnetic-dipole (MD), and electric-quadrupole (EQ) contributions on equal footing. Applied to two prototypical two-dimensional chiral hybrid perovskites, (S-NEA)2PbBr4 and (S-MBA)2PbI4, our calculations reveal that MD and EQ channels contribute equally to the CD signal. Crucially, intraband and quasi-degenerate transitions only captured within FMC can significantly modify CD spectra, especially in systems with dense band degeneracies. The FMC framework, therefore, offers a computationally efficient and numerically robust way for predicting chiral optoelectronic phenomena in complex solids.</description>

      <title>Layerwise Stratification and Band Reordering in Twisted Multilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalizable, physics informed strategy for generating training data that enables a machine learning force field accurate over a broad range of twist angles and stacking layer numbers in moire systems. Applying this to multilayer twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2), we identify a structural and electronic stratification: the two moire interface (MI) layers retain substantial lattice reconstruction even in thick multilayers, while outer bulk like layers show rapidly attenuated distortions.Surprisingly, this stratification becomes strongest not in the ultra-small twist angle regime (&lt;~1{\deg}), where in plane domain formation is well known, but rather at intermediate angles (2-5{\deg}). Simultaneously, interlayer hybridization across the MI-bulk boundary is strongly suppressed, leading to electronic isolation. In twisted double bilayer MoTe2, this stratification gives rise to coexisting honeycomb and triangular lattice motifs in the frontier valence bands. We further demonstrate that twist angle and weak gating can create energy shift of bands belonging to the two motifs, producing Chern band reordering and nonlinear electric polarization with modest hole doping. Our approach allows efficient simulation of multilayer moire systems and reveals structural-electronic separation phenomena absent in bilayer systems.</description>

      <title>Exciton collective modes in a bilayer of axion insulator $\text{MnBi}_2 \text{Te}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an exciton condensate and associated collective modes in a bilayer configuration of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$, an antiferromagnetic topological insulator and van der Waals material, recognized for hosting axion physics. Utilizing a minimal low-energy Hamiltonian for the two layer system which is gapped by the intrinsic N\'eel order, we first employ mean-field theory to establish the conditions for exciton condensation. Our analysis identifies a nonzero, spin-singlet exciton order parameter which is tuned by external displacement field, temperature, and Coulomb attraction. Beyond the mean-field, we explore collective mode fluctuations in the uncondensed phase via many-body perturbation theory and the random phase approximation. From this, we derive the exciton spectral function which allows for a direct comparison between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. We detail how the softening of the collective mode peak is a function of the competition between interlayer detuning and thermal fluctuations. This work elucidates how the unique topological and magnetic environment of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$ offers a tunable platform for the realization and manipulation of exciton condensates and the corresponding collective excitations. Our findings contribute to understanding the interplay of topology and bosonic condensates, which could inspire application in optically accessing topological properties, dissipationless transport, and gate-tunable optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Influence of high-temperature overgrowth on electronic states and phonon mode localized at GaP/Si(001) heterointerface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice-matched GaP layers can be grown on Si(001) substrate via a two-step growth procedure, consisting of low-temperature nucleation followed by high-temperature overgrowth. Previous time-resolved spectroscopic studies on a thin GaP nucleation layer discovered a discrete electronic state and a phonon mode at 2 THz, both localized at the heterointerface and enhanced resonantly at pump photon energy of 1.4~eV. Here we investigate the influence of the high-temperature overgrowth on the interface electronic state and the 2-THz phonon mode. We find that the high-temperature overgrowth quenches the 1.4-eV resonances in the electronic transition and in the phonon amplitude, yet the 2-THz phonon mode is still observed after the overgrowth. Furthermore, the optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is qualitatively different between before and after the overgrowth. Our observations imply that the phonon frequency is defined by robust local atomic bondings such as Ga-Si at the heterointerface. The phonon amplitude, on the other hand, is determined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition, which is dominated by the discrete state before the overgrowth and by charge transfer between the valence bands of the two semiconductors after the overgrowth.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrahigh Anomalous Hall Conductivities via Optimally Prepared Topological Floquet States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast quantum matter experiments have validated predictions from Floquet theory - notably, the dynamical modification of the electronic band structure and the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, via monotonic modulation of the driving amplitude. Here, we demonstrate how new physics is uncovered by leveraging quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles. We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve &gt;99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications.</description>

      <title>Pronounced scale-dependent charge carrier density in graphene quantum Hall devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of quantum Hall resistance standards (QHRS) using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide necessitates understanding how device dimensions impact performance. This study reveals a pronounced scale-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices: under electron doping, carrier density decreases with increasing channel width (Wd), while the opposite occurs under hole doping. This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence. Utilizing machine learning with limited data, we optimized the device geometry, identifying a channel width of ~360 um as the optimal balance between resistance uncertainty and on-chip integration density. This work provides key insights for designing high-performance, miniaturized graphene-based QHRS arrays.</description>

      <title>Metastable Multi-centered Polarons in BiVO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons, quasiparticles formed through interactions between lattice and charge carriers (electrons and holes), strongly influence the electronic and optical properties of functional materials. In nanostructured BiVO$_{4}$, polaron formation and dynamics govern photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport, yet the microscopic nature remains not fully resolved. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the formation of multi-centered polarons, in contrast to the more common single-centered states. Moreover, electron polarons exhibit pronounced anisotropy compared to the isotropic hole counterpart, reflecting a distinct character in charge-lattice coupling. These theoretical insights offer a direct interpretation of optical and spectroscopic experiments, providing strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO$_{4}$. The presence of multiple in-gap states, especially from multi-centered polarons, introduces new channels for charge transport and recombination, possibly offering opportunities to control carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Universal Critical Scaling and Phase Diagram of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect under Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard scaling theory dictates that disorder leads to immediate localization in one-dimensional Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology fundamentally alters this paradigm, protecting transport up to a substantial critical disorder strength. By employing a numerically stable log-space transfer matrix approach up to thermodynamic scales (N=1000), we identify a sharp phase transition from the topological skin phase to the Anderson localized phase. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents \nu\approx1.50 and \beta\approx0.65. Furthermore, we map the global phase diagram, confirming that the critical disorder scales as W_c\propto\sqrt\gamma, consistent with localization suppression by an imaginary vector potential. Our results establish the rigorous limits of non-Hermitian topological protection in imperfect media.</description>

      <title>Water induced bandgap engineering in nanoribbons of hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It has been predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator-metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that water adsorption greatly reduces bandgap of zigzag oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water adsorbed beside the BNNR induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2 V/nm thereby reducing its bandgap. Field effect transistors were successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of zBNNRs with adsorbates of water could be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements were taken to determine the optical bandgap in zBNNR. Wider zBNNRs exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17 eV. This study yields fundamental insights in new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Learning Degenerate Manifolds of Frustrated Magnets with Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.</description>

      <title>Pseudopotentials for Orbital-Free DFT: Capturing Nonlocality and Correcting Functional Approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Current-Driven Vortex Formation in High-$T_c$ Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II superconductors exhibit hysteretic behavior due to the presence of quantum vortices, and the order in which temperature and external field are varied plays a decisive role. Here we take current, rather than magnetic field, as the external drive. We image the magnetic field of a high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor strip after cooling. We confirm that even in zero magnetic field, current-biased cooling nucleates vortices within the strip. With a small external magnetic field, the distribution is polarized opposite to the Lorentz-force direction. These behaviors follow from the self-consistent relation between current and local field in steady flux flow. Our findings show that current history is encoded as vortices. This reveals self-field effects that influence dc measurements and glassy transitions under drive.</description>

      <title>Phase Field Study of Exchange Coupling of Hard/Soft Ferrite on Magnetic Permeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective modulation of magnetic permeability plays a vital role in the development of high-performance inductors. Here, phase-field simulations of hard/soft ferrite composites (BaM/NiZn) clarify how exchange coupling and microstructure impact magnetic permeability. We show that particle size, volume fraction, and orientation of the hard phase can effectively control the transition from collinear to non-collinear coupling, with a critical exchange size r_cr approximately 12 nm. Increasing the hard-phase fraction deepens the anisotropy energy well and monotonically suppresses permeability. In contrast, rotating the BaM easy axis to 90 degrees relative to the applied field produces a strong enhancement: at a 10 nm radius and eta = 0.1 volume fraction, the effective permeability can be more than 30 times larger than in the parallel configuration and then saturates for larger particles. This study establishes a microstructure-permeability-based physical framework for designing hard/soft magnetic composite systems.</description>

      <title>Percolative Pathway to Stripe Order in KTaO3-Based Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of low dimensional superconductors to fluctuations gives rise to emergent behaviors beyond the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer framework. Anisotropy is one such manifestation, often linked to spatially modulated electronic states and unconventional pairing mechanisms. Pronounced in plane anisotropy recently reported at KTaO3 based oxide interfaces points to the emergence of a stripe order in superconducting phase, yet its microscopic origin and formation pathway remain unresolved. Here, we show that controlled interfacial disorder in MgO/KTaO3(111) heterostructures drives a percolative evolution from localized Cooper-pair islands to superconducting puddles and eventually to stripes. The extracted stripe width matches the spin precession length, suggesting a self organized modulation governed by spin orbit coupling and lattice-symmetry breaking. These findings identify disorder as both a tuning parameter and a diagnostic probe for emergent superconductivity in two dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature stability of skyrmion crystals in frustrated magnets: Role of sixfold anisotropy and uniform spin mode in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature stability of skyrmion crystals in frustrated magnets by analyzing the momentum-space exchange interaction of a classical Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice. Our analysis identifies two key momentum-space features that play a crucial role in stabilizing the skyrmion crystal phase. The first is the sixfold anisotropy in the momentum-space exchange interaction, which acts as a locking potential favoring triple-$Q$ skyrmion crystals. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that a larger anisotropy tends to enhance the stability region of the skyrmion crystal in the temperature--magnetic-field phase diagram. The second factor is the momentum-space energy related to the uniform spin mode, which correlates with the emergence of the skyrmion crystal phase at finite temperatures. These results provide a further understanding of the stabilization mechanism of the skyrmion crystal phase in frustrated magnets and will be useful for the design of skyrmion-hosting materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid heterostructures combining transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with light-harvesting dyes are promising materials for next-generation optoelectronics. Yet, controlling and understanding interfacial charge transfer mechanisms in these complex systems remains a major challenge. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of photoluminescence (PL) quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$ functionalized with a novel, strongly electron-deficient perylene monoimide dye, $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$. Experimentally, the hybridization induces a $\sim$97\% PL quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$, confirming substantial static charge transfer and increased $p$-doping from the dye. To isolate the dominant electronic mechanism, we investigate from first principles various interface morphologies, including differing molecular orientations and layer thicknesses. Our density-functional theory results confirm that $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$ acts as a strong electron acceptor, inducing $p$-doping and forming a type-II level alignment with all considered configurations, giving rise to a small or vanishing band gap. Based on these findings, we attribute the observed PL suppression in $\text{WSe}_2$ to these strong electronic interactions with the dye. Our study provides a clear and validated strategy for tailoring the electronic structure of TMDs through targeted, electron-deficient organic functionalization.</description>

      <title>Structural evolution of iron oxides melts at Earth's outer-core pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen and other light elements comprise up to 5 wt% of the Earth's outer-core, and may significantly influence its physical properties and the operation of the geodynamo. Here we report in situ x-ray diffraction measurements of Fe, Fe + 4.5 FeO (atomic proportion), and Fe2O3 melts at 177-438 GPa, achieved using laser-driven shock compression at an x-ray free-electron laser. The melts exhibit Fe-O coordination numbers between 4.0(0.4) and 4.5(0.4), indicating predominantly four-fold coordination environments. These coordination states are significantly smaller than those of Fe-bearing lower-mantle phases such as bridgmanite and ferropericlase. Shorter Fe-Fe interatomic distances in compressed iron oxide melts drive the denser packing relative to ambient melts, while the structural differences between Fe + 4.5 FeO and Fe2O3 melts under shock indicate that the oxidation state modulates oxygen solubility in liquid Fe. At around 177 GPa (380 km below the core-mantle boundary), Fe2O3 melts exhibit higher Fe-O coordination, suggesting that local variations in oxygen content could contribute to the stratification in the uppermost outer-core inferred from seismological and geomagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>Valley physics in the two bands k.p model for SiGe heterostructures and spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the choice and implementation of inter-valley potentials in the so-called two bands k.p model for the opposite X, Y or Z valleys of silicon. We focus on the description of valley splittings in Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubits, with a particular attention to alloy disorder. We demonstrate that the two bands k.p model reproduces the valley splittings of atomistic tight-binding calculations in relevant heterostructures (SiGe spikes, wiggle wells...), yet at a much lower cost. We show that the model also captures the effects of valley-orbit mixing and yields the correct inter-valley dipole matrix elements that characterize manipulation, dephasing and relaxation in spin/valley qubits. We simulate a realistic Si/SiGe spin qubit device as an illustration, and discuss electron-phonon interactions in the two bands k.p model. Beyond spin qubits, this model enables efficient simulations of SiGe heterostructure devices where spin and valley physics are relevant.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the spin glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently showed that the two-dimensional Ising spin glass allows for a line of renormalization group fixed points. We observe that this exact result corresponds to enhancement to a one-generator continuous internal symmetry. This finally explains why no finite temperature transition to a spin glass phase is observed in two dimensions. In more than two dimensions, instead, the continuous symmetry can be broken spontaneously and yields a spin glass order parameter which, for fixed temperature and disorder strength, takes continuous values in an interval. Such a feature is shared by the order parameter of the known mean field solution of the model with infinite-range interactions, which corresponds to infinitely many dimensions.</description>

      <title>Microwave spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene is a maturing material platform for gate-defined quantum dots that hosts long-lived spin and valley states. Implementing solid-state qubits in bilayer graphene requires a fundamental understanding of such confined electronic systems. In particular, states of two and three carriers, for which the exchange interaction between particles plays a crucial role, are a cornerstone for qubit readout and manipulation. Here we report on the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques that offer substantially improved energy resolution compared to standard transport techniques. Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field. The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures.</description>

      <title>High-pressure melting and elastic behavior of vanadium and niobium based on ab initio and machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under high pressure, the group-VB transition metals vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) exhibit simple crystal structures but complex physical behaviors, such as anomalous compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH). Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals.</description>

      <title>Drastic reduction of the slow scintillation component in highly luminescent Ce3+ and Mg2+ doped Lu2.5Gd0.5Ga2Al3O12 garnet powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the photochemical preparation of nanomaterials with garnet structure. Ce3+ and Mg2+ doped Lu2.5Gd0.5Ga2Al3O12 powders were prepared by using UV irradiation of aqueous solutions with low-pressure mercury lamps and subsequent calcination of the solid products. The synthesis was optimized and gives access to a range of doping which is very hard to achieve with single crystal growth from melt. The effect of Ce and Mg concentration on the structural and luminescence properties was studied. Garnets were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and their luminescence properties under optical and X-ray photon excitations were investigated. XRF and XRD show that the samples are sufficiently chemically pure and phase-pure and their elemental composition corresponds with expectations. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy confirmed that Mg concentrations in Mg-codoped samples are slightly lower than the nominal. Luminescence spectra show typical emission maxima of 5d-4f Ce3+ transition and 4f-4f Gd3+ transition. The effects of the concentration of Ce3+ and Mg2+ on the RL intensity, light yields and decays were observed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall responses in tunable nodal Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Hall responses in tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials. In particular, we study quantum geometry-driven second and third order non-linear responses in a time-reversal symmetric Dirac semimetal that can host single, double and line nodes depending on the model parameters. We find that the second-order Hall response (SOHE), which originates from the Berry curvature dipole, is enhanced in the single-node semimetallic phase as compared to the double node case when inversion symmetry is broken. In contrast, the SOHE vanishes in the nodal line semimetal as the inversion symmetry retains. Notably, the third-order Hall response due to Berry connection polarizabilty becomes much larger in the line-node Dirac semimetal, especially when the Fermi energy lies near the band edge, than in the single- and double-node Dirac semimetals. The reason for this contrasting behavior is attributed to the distinct distribution of the Berry connection polarizability in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Escaping AB caging via Floquet engineering: photo-induced long-range interference in an all-band-flat model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model employing the recently developed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method. While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models.</description>

      <title>Ta-based Josephson junctions using insulating ALD TaN tunnel barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions form the core circuit element in superconducting quantum computing circuits, single flux quantum digital logic circuits, and sensing devices such as SQUIDs. Aluminum oxide has typically been used as the tunnel barrier. Its formation by exposure to low oxygen pressures at room temperature for short periods of time makes it susceptible to aging and limits the thermal budget of downstream processes. In this paper, we report the first demonstration of {\alpha}-Ta/insulating TaN/a-Ta superconductor/insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions fabricated on 300 mm wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. The junctions were fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates using standard processes available at 300 mm scale, including 193 nm optical lithography, ALD of TaN in a cluster tool, and chemical mechanical planarization to enable highly planar interfaces. Junction areas ranging from 0.03 um2 to 9 um2 with ALD TaN thickness between 2 nm and 7 nm were characterized. A critical current density of 76 uA/um2 was observed in junctions using 4 nm ALD TaN in the tunnel barrier. The dependence of Jc on ALD TaN layer thickness is analyzed, and the influence of junction geometry, packaging, and temperature on I-V characteristics is discussed. Junctions were retested after a period of 4 months to quantify junction aging. The potential of this novel material system and a 300 mm superconducting junction process flow to fabricate thermally and environmentally stable junctions is discussed. The vision of a Superconducting Quantum Process Design Kit for a Multi-Project Wafer program to enable rapid development and proliferation of superconducting quantum and digital digital logic systems is presented. This work represents the first step towards establishing such a Quantum Foundry, providing access to high quality qubits and single-flux quantum logic circuits at 300 mm wafer scale.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order Unlocks Optical Access to Dark Excitons in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quasiparticles that intertwine magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom underpin emerging strategies for manipulating and transducing quantum information in solids. A key missing element has been the ability to optically access dark excitons - optically forbidden but functionally crucial states that shape energy flow, coherence, and spin dynamics in quantum materials. Here we show that exciton-magnon coupling provides an optical gateway to dark excitons in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr. Broadband femtosecond reflectivity reveals a dark exciton at 1.46 eV that is entirely absent in static optical spectra but becomes visible through its coherent hybridization with a GHz magnon. High-photon-energy excitation further allows active control of the hybrid dispersion, enabling strong renormalization and selective enhancement of exciton-magnon interactions. These results establish a general mechanism by which magnetic order renders dark excitons optically addressable, opening a pathway toward engineered hybrid spin-exciton platforms for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Skyrmions on a Racetrack: Impact of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-driven motion of domain walls and skyrmions is central to the operation of non-volatile magnetic memory devices. Racetrack memory requires current densities high enough to generate velocities above 50 m/s, but such conditions also enhance spin-current noise. We develop a theoretical framework based on the stochastic Thiele equation to analyze the effects of equilibrium (thermal) and nonequilibrium (spin-current) fluctuations on skyrmion dynamics. From this approach, we derive diffusion coefficients and mean-squared displacements that quantify stochastic motion under both noise sources. Micromagnetic simulations and analytical results demonstrate that spin-current noise dominates skyrmion dynamics in typical racetrack structures up to room temperature. We further address the first-passage-time problem, obtaining the mean first-passage time and its standard deviation along and across the racetrack. These results quantify how random displacements affect skyrmion propagation and detection, providing insights into error sources in high-speed racetrack memory devices.</description>

      <title>Landau-level-dependent photonic spin Hall effect in monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau level (LL) engineered photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) holds great promise for nanoscale manipulation and steering of magneto-optical transport in two-dimensional atomic systems. Herein, we theoretically investigate PSHE modulated by LL transitions {\delta}n = n'-n =-2, 0, +2 (where n and n' indicate the LL indexes of valence and conduction bands, respectively) in monolayer WTe2. Results show that PSHE tuned by {\delta}n =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle {\Theta} because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of {\Theta} with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55&gt;-&gt;|n'=57&gt;. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the {\Theta} is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |{\Theta}| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillations of a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of an impurity under the action of a constant force through a one-dimensional system of weakly-interacting bosons. The interplay of the impurity-boson interaction, the boson-boson interaction, and the driving force gives rise to a rich dynamics. We focus on the influence of a finite external force. Under these far-from-equilibrium conditions, we show that in a wide range of forces, one part of the momentum transferred to the system is periodically channeled into the Bose gas through the emission of dispersive density shock waves, solitons, density waves and the creation of additional phase gradients. As a result, the impurity velocity does not increase indefinitely, but periodically oscillates in time around the drift velocity. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in a wide range of the impurity-boson coupling, the impurity mass and the external force. At a sufficiently large force, the Bloch oscillations cease and the impurity exhibits an unlimited acceleration.</description>

      <title>Signatures of coherent phonon transport in frequency dependent lattice thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in highly anharmonic, amorphous, or alloyed materials often deviates from the predictions of conventional phonon-based models. First-principles approaches have introduced a coherent contribution to account for these deviations and to explain ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity, but direct experimental evidence for this mechanism remains elusive. Here, we propose that the frequency-dependent lattice thermal conductivity, $\kappa(\nu)$, provides a direct signature of coherent transport. Specifically, we show that peaks in $\kappa(\nu)$ arise from the frequency nesting of modes with identical wave vectors. Applying this approach to CuCl, we identify clear signatures of coherent transport in its dynamical lattice thermal conductivity. We revisit the interpretation of thermoreflectance experiments and argue that the conventional understanding breaks down in strongly anharmonic crystals, alloys, and amorphous materials. Finally, we discuss experimental pathways to measure $\kappa(\nu)$, offering a new route to verify coherent contributions in thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Spin current symmetries generated by GdFeCo ferrimagnet across its magnetisation compensation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets, composed of antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic sublattices whose net magnetisation can be tuned by temperature, offer a unique platform for probing the symmetry of the spin currents they generate and for identifying the sublattice contributions to these currents. Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Imaging of Moir\'e-Confined Excitons in Twisted Bilayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted two-dimensional semiconductors generate a moir\'e landscape that confines excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) into programmable lattices, offering routes to efficient light sources, sensing, and room-temperature information processing. However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moir\'e unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moir\'e of a 2$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moir\'e, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moir\'e-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moir\'e-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moir\'e excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Tuning Yttrium {\Sigma}7(0001) Twist Grain Boundary Properties through Segregation and Co-segregation of Low Neutron Absorption Elements: First-Principles Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elements with low thermal neutron absorption cross-sections are ideal for enhancing structural materials in nuclear systems. In this study, We systematically investigate the segregation and co-segregation behaviors of eleven elements at the {\Sigma}7(0001) twist grain boundary in yttrium and their effects on stability and strength. The {\Sigma}7(0001) grain boundary exhibits weakening, with fracture occurring preferentially along path I. Segregation energy calculations show that Si, Cu, Cr, Mo and Fe prefer interstitial sites, while others occupy substitutional ones. Si, Al, Zn, Cu, Mg and Fe stabilize the boundary, while Mo, Fe, Si, Cr, Cu, Nb and Ti strengthen it, with Si offering the most balanced improvement. Co-segregation studies reveal that Si induces the enrichment of other solutes at the boundary, promoting synergistic stabilization and turning embrittling elements (Al, Mg, Zn, Zr) into strengthening agents. Electronic structure analysis shows that Si-Y covalent bonds enhance electron localization, and Si+Mg co-segregation optimizes electronic distribution through metallic-covalent cooperation, significantly improving fracture resistance. The density of states analysis indicates new low-energy deep states in the Si, and Si+Al, Si+Mg systems, which lower grain boundary energy and improve stability. This study provides guidance for designing high-performance, low-neutron-absorption Y-based alloys.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junctions for sensors and electronics:Different geometry, new functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Impact of the valence band on Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex valence band structure of bulk cuprous oxide necessitates going beyond the parabolic approximation to precisely estimate exciton binding energies. The same is true for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, for which many effects have been obtained so far only qualitatively within a hydrogenlike two-band model. Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated.</description>

      <title>Single-hole spectral functions in 1D quantum magnets with different ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,\omega)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,\tau)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,\omega)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and reshape a material's spatial symmetry. Because the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is exquisitely sensitive to symmetry, it offers a natural arena for magnetic-field control. Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.</description>

      <title>Physically Interpretable Interatomic Potentials via Symbolic Regression and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of next-generation molecular simulation models requires moving beyond pre-defined functional forms toward machine learning (ML) techniques that directly capture multiscale physics. Here, we demonstrate such an approach using symbolic regression (SR) with equation learner networks and a reinforcement learning search engine to derive interpretable equations for interatomic interactions. Training data were generated through nested ensemble sampling with density functional theory (DFT) energetics, spanning crystalline to highly disordered states. The optimization of the learner network employed continuous-action Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with gradient descent, enabling efficient exploration of function space. For copper as a representative transition metal, an unconstrained search produced models that outperformed fixed-form Sutton-Chen EAM potentials. The SR-derived models (SR1 and SR2) reproduced key material properties - lattice constants, cohesive energies, equations of state, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, defect formation energies, surface/bulk energetics, and phase transformation with significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, stringent melting simulations using two-phase solid-amorphous interfaces confirmed that SR models accurately capture the interplay of vibrational entropy, cohesive energy, and structural dynamics, surpassing SC-EAM in both qualitative and quantitative predictions. This highlights the potential of SR to deliver fast, accurate, flexible, and physically meaningful potentials, advancing predictive modeling across scales.</description>

      <title>Orbital Longitudinal Magnetoelectricity in Quasi-2D Parity-Violating Antiferromagnets: Interplay of Berry Phase and Stacking Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect traditionally arises from complex spin-orbital interactions in multiferroic materials. In this work, we propose a distinct, intrinsic mechanism for the magnetoelectric effect in quasi-2D magnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry. We demonstrate that in such parity-violating magnets, the stacking order, which id coupled with Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, generates a stacking Berry curvature dipole (SBCD) and a stacking orbital magnetic moment dipole (SOMD). The SBCD and SOMD act as fundamental ingredients of the ME response. As concrete examples, we apply our framework to antiferromagnets such as monolayer Ca(CoN)$_2$ and multilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with stacking magnetic orders. Our results reveal the microscopic orbital origin of the ME effect in antiferromagnetic systems with vanishing net Berry curvature and orbital magnetization, governed by the interplay between layer stacking, Berry curvature, and magnetic order. The SBCD is also identified as the origin of electric-field-induced Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Tuning entanglement phases and topological memory in the measurement-only Kitaev model with single and multi-qubit checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits provide an emerging controllable platform to realize novel dynamical non-equilibrium phases including topologically ordered states. The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of superfluidity for hard-core dark excitons on the triangular lattice by mapping the large-$U$ Bose--Hubbard model to an effective XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hamiltonian including virtual hopping processes. Within this framework, we identify the superfluid phase that emerges between the two Mott-insulating endpoints at fillings 0 and 1, and derive its mean-field structure via a canted-spin solution. We then construct the corresponding continuum Landau-Ginzburg (LG) functional and analyze phase fluctuations and vortex dynamics. In two dimensions, the superfluid--normal transition is shown to be governed by a Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) mechanism with a stiffness determined by microscopic parameters. Our results provide a unified description connecting lattice-scale exciton dynamics to continuum critical behavior in triangular geometries.</description>

      <title>Precision thermodynamics of the strongly interacting Fermi gas in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-species cold atomic Fermi gas with attractive short-range interactions in two spatial dimensions undergoes a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) crossover as a function of $\ln (k_F a)$, where $a$ is the scattering length. However, the nature of this crossover in the strong coupling regime $\ln(k_F a) \sim 1$ remains poorly understood. In this work we use canonical-ensemble auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods on discrete lattices to calculate several thermodynamical quantities in the strongly interacting regime, and eliminate systematic errors by extrapolating to continuous time and taking the continuum limit. In particular, we present results for the condensate fraction, spin susceptibility, contact, energy equation of state, and the free energy staggering gap. We identify signatures of a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations survive above the critical temperature for superfluidity, in the spin susceptibility and in the free energy staggering gap. These results can be used as a benchmark for future experiments.</description>

      <title>From quantum geometry to non-linear optics and gerbes: Recent advances in topological band theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological principles constitute at present an integral component of condensed matter physics, permeating the modern characterization of electronic states while also guiding materials design. In this brief Perspective, I highlight three research threads in single-particle topological band theory that have recently gained momentum: (i) the rise of the quantum geometric tensor, whose components can at present be directly accessed with optical probes; (ii) the notions of delicate and multigap topology, which fall outside the scope of tenfold way and symmetry-based indicators yet leave robust physical fingerprints; and (iii) the consideration of bundle gerbes, which capture formerly overlooked higher-form topological aspects of energy bands. These distinct directions have been elegantly woven together: delicate and multigap topological insulators have peculiar features in quantum geometry that can be conveniently captured by bundle gerbes. This viewpoint exposes the recently identified quantization of a non-linear optical response and provides outlooks for its realization in crystalline solids.</description>

      <title>Carrier transport and electrical bandgaps in epitaxial CrN layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport properties and electrical bandgap of nominally undoped ~75-nm-thick CrN layers simultaneously grown on AlN(0001) and AlN(11\bar{2}2) templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy are investigated. The layers grown on AlN(0001) and AlN(11\bar{2}2) exhibit (111) and (113) surface orientations, respectively. All layers exhibit antiferromagnetism with a N\'eel temperature of ~280 K, observed by temperature-dependent magnetic and electrical measurements. Hall-effect measurements demonstrate n-type semiconducting behavior across a wide temperature range from 4 to 920 K. At low temperatures (4 - 260 K), the data show parallel conduction channels from a metallic impurity band and the conduction band. The carrier mobility exhibits a temperature dependence consistent with a nondegenerate semiconductor, governed by ionized-impurity scattering below 400 K and phonon scattering above 400 K. An analysis of the temperature-dependent carrier density between 300 and 920 K yields two activation energies associated with intrinsic conduction: 0.15 eV (with an uncertainty of -0.02/+0.10 eV), which we attribute to the fundamental bandgap, and 0.50 eV (with an uncertainty of -0.05/+0.15 eV) representing a higher energy transition.</description>

      <title>Holographic duality between bulk topological order and boundary mixed-state order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for analyzing the steady states of repeated quantum channels with strong symmetries. Using channel-state duality, we show that the steady state of a $d$-dimensional quantum channel is holographically mapped to the boundary reduced density matrix of a $(d+1)$-dimensional wavefunction generated by a sequential unitary circuit. From this perspective, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in the steady state arises from the anyon condensation on the boundary of a topological order in one higher dimension. The conditional mutual information (CMI) associated with SWSSB is then inherited from the bulk topological entanglement entropy. We make this duality explicit using isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) by identifying the channel's time evolution with the transfer matrix of a higher-dimensional isoTNS. Built on isoTNS, we further construct continuously tunable quantum channels that exhibit distinct mixed-state phases and transitions in the steady states.</description>

      <title>No-go theorems for sequential preparation of two-dimensional chiral states via channel-state correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether sequential unitary circuits can prepare two-dimensional chiral states, using a correspondence between sequentially prepared states, isometric tensor network states, and one-dimensional quantum channel circuits. We establish two no-go theorems, one for Gaussian fermion systems and one for generic interacting systems. In Gaussian fermion systems, the correspondence relates the defining features of chiral wave functions in their entanglement spectrum to the algebraic decaying correlations in the steady state of channel dynamics. We establish the no-go theorem by proving that local channel dynamics with translational invariance cannot support such correlations. As a direct implication, two-dimensional Gaussian fermion isometric tensor network states cannot support algebraically decaying correlations in all directions or represent a chiral state. In generic interacting systems, we establish a no-go theorem by showing that the state prepared by sequential circuits cannot host the tripartite entanglement of a chiral state due to the constraints from causality.</description>

      <title>Localization and Delocalization of Quantum Trajectories in the Liouvillian Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems by analyzing individual quantum trajectories in the eigenbasis of the Liouvillian superoperator. From trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, we construct a quasiprobability distribution that characterizes the degree of localization of the trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis. Contrary to the common wisdom that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and the slowest-decaying modes, we show that trajectories can remain well spread over transient eigenstates deep within the bulk of the Liouvillian spectrum even at late times. We demonstrate this explicitly using numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems. Moreover, we find that the delocalization of the trajectory strongly correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, establishing a further link between the trajectory and ensemble pictures of open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Landau Paradigm for quantum phases and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau paradigm is a central dogma for understanding phase and phase transitions in condensed matter systems, yet for decades it has been known that a variety of quantum phases exist beyond the framework. Is there a more general framework that provides a systematic understanding of phase and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems? Recent developments of the notion of generalized symmetry and generalized gauging seem to point to a way to generalize the Landau Paradigm. In this essay, we discuss how `beyond Landau' phases and phase transitions can be captured by a generalized Landau paradigm in terms of the breaking of generalized symmetries, often induced by the generalized gauging procedure facilitated through the topological holography formalism. We also discuss what needs to be understood to make the generalized Landau paradigm useful in the study of quantum phase and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Control of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Two-Dimensional Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) -- the anomalous boundary accumulation of an extensive number of bulk modes -- has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with broad implications for transport, sensing, and topological classification. A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: At the beginning of the 70's, Baxter introduced a multiparametric generalization of the six-vertex model. This integrable system has been found to exhibit a remarkable variety of critical behaviors. The work is part of a series of papers devoted to their systematic study. We focus on the case when the lattice model possesses an additional ${\cal Z}_r$ symmetry and consider the critical behavior near the so-called free fermion point. Among other things, discussed is the algebra of extended conformal symmetry underlying the universal behavior. The main result of the paper is the class of differential equations that describe the scaling limit of the solutions to the Bethe Ansatz equations. This is an instance of the correspondence between Ordinary Differential Equations and Integrable Quantum Field Theory (ODE/IQFT correspondence).</description>

      <title>Extracting conserved operators from a projected entangled pair state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a tensor network state, how can we determine conserved operators (including Hamiltonians) for which the state is an eigenstate? We answer this question by presenting a method to extract geometrically $k$-local conserved operators that have the given infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) in 2D as an (approximate) eigenstate. The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Dielectric breakdown of strongly correlated insulators in one dimension: Universal formula from non-Hermitian sine-Gordon theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Application of a strong electric field to insulators induces a finite current. This phenomenon is called dielectric breakdown and is known as a fundamental nonequilibrium and nonlinear transport phenomenon in solids. Here, we study the dielectric breakdown of generic strongly correlated insulators in one dimension. Combining bosonization techniques with a quantum tunneling theory, we develop an effective field-theoretical description of dielectric breakdown using a non-Hermitian sine-Gordon theory. Then, we derive an analytic formula for the threshold field, which is a many-body generalization of the Landau-Zener formula. Importantly, we point out that the threshold field contains a previously overlooked factor originating from the charges of elementary excitations, which should be significant when a system has fractionalized excitations. We apply our results to integrable lattice models and confirm that our formula is valid in a broad range including the weak coupling regime, indicating its wide potential applicability. Our results unveil universal aspects of nonlinear and nonequilibrium transport phenomena in various strongly correlated insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.03857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetism in tilted fermionic Mott insulators. With a small tilt, the fermions are still localized and form a Mott-insulating state, where the localized spins interact via antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. While the localized state is naively expected to be broken with a large tilt, in fact, the fermions are still localized under a large tilt due to the Wannier-Stark localization and it can be regarded as a localized spin system. We find that the sign of the exchange coupling is changed and the ferromagnetic interaction is realized under the large tilt. To show this, we employ perturbation theory and real-time numerical simulation of the fermionic Hubbard chain. Our simulation exhibits that it is possible to effectively control the speed and time direction of the dynamics by changing the size of the tilt, which may be useful for experimentally measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators. Finally, we discuss experimental platforms, such as ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, to observe these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hasse Diagrams for Gapless SPT and SSB Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00905v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.</description>

      <title>Entropy-induced confinement in two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials hold the potential for exploring new frontiers of physics that extend beyond Maxwell's equations. We have previously proposed a two-dimensional magnetic monopole gas (2DMG), confined at the interface between spin-ice ($R_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho) and antiferromagnetic iridate ($R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho), which hosts monopoles with a net charge. The mechanism behind the 2D confinement of the monopole gas remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that entropy is a key factor in the 2D confinement of this monopole gas. We reveal that the competition between the entropy of spin-ice, which favors the 2D confinement, and the entropy of the monopoles' random walks, which favors the deconfinement, dictates the distribution of the monopoles within a few layers close to the interface. Our entropy-based model accurately reproduces the monopole distribution obtained from the spin model, affirming that 2D confinement is entropy-driven. We further employ both models to show that the monopole distribution can be manipulated by an external magnetic field and temperature, holding promise for next-generation devices based on magnetic monopoles. Our findings reveal the entropic mechanisms in 2DMG, enabling the manipulation of emergent quasiparticles at material interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore how light-driven optical phonons can be used to drive magnetic exchange interactions into interesting physical regimes by developing a general theory of spin-phonon pumping in magnetic insulators with non-equilibrium optical phonon distributions, focusing on the diabatic regime where phonon frequencies are much larger than the magnetic interactions. We present several applications of spin-phonon pumping two-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg, XYZ and Kitaev models to examine what kind of further neighbor interactions and chiral fields can be generated, and how anisotropic couplings can be enhanced, showing that experimentally accessible non-equilibrium phonon distributions can generically drive significant frustration and realize a variety of spin liquid regimes. This effect is described for both direct and superexchange mechanisms, and we derive simple geometric rules for which phonon modes are ``spin-phonon'' active and for which magnetic interactions. Spin-phonon pumping provides an intriguing possibility for preferentially pumping specific magnetic interaction terms. In addition to generating further neighbor interactions, such pumping can lead to increased magnetic anisotropy for initially weakly anisotropic models, and selectively pumping the Kitaev-Heisenberg model can suppress undesirable Heisenberg terms while enhancing Kitaev interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

Abstract: Searching for ambient-pressure conventional superconductors with critical temperatures (TC) higher than 40 K is a key challenge in the field of high-temperature superconductivity, mainly due to lack of efficient and effective models to estimate TC of potential systems. In this work, we propose a simplified model to estimate the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling (EPC) strength {\lambda} by separately treating the EPC matrix elements which evaluate the pairing strength and the phonon-assisted nesting function P({\omega}) which evaluates the matching of electron bands and phonon spectra for forming potential electron pairs via phonons. Our model illuminates the critical role of P({\omega}) and its spectral integral P in determining {\lambda}, i.e., high P is a necessary condition leading to large {\lambda} and thus high TC, which is further demonstrated by showing that the reported high-TC traditional superconductors in literatures all have high P. As an easily quantifiable parameter, P({\omega}) and P provide an efficient and effective descriptor for accelerating the discovery and rational design of high-TC superconductors. By applying the model to screen over the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), we successfully identify several high-TC superconducting systems as confirmed by accurate first-principles calculations. Our model opens new avenues for exploring high-TC systems.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnetism has sparked renewed interest in the growth of epitaxial films of the NiAs-phase polymorph of CrSb. This paper describes the magnetron sputtering-based fabrication and characterization of high-quality single crystalline CrSb(0001) thin films supported by an isostructural nonmagnetic PtSb buffer. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that the films are phase pure and possess a very high crystalline quality (mosaicity ~0.05deg), while also being free of extended crystallographic defects. Both scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirm their smooth and homogeneous topography. Additionally, the elemental composition of our films was found to be close to stoichiometric via electron probe microanalysis and x-ray fluorescence. Thus, the developed samples represent an ideal platform for further investigation of the material properties of CrSb.</description>

      <title>Coherent suppression and dephasing-induced reentrance of high harmonics in gapped Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Enhanced coherent terahertz emission from critical superconducting fluctuations in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent terahertz (THz) emission is emerging as a powerful new tool to probe symmetry breakings in quantum materials. This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Formulation of the orbital magnetic moment in multiorbital tight-binding models: Application to the inverse Faraday effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a theoretical formulation of the orbital magnetic moment in multiorbital tight-binding models, focusing on the role of the electric dipole. We demonstrate that the total magnetic moment can be decomposed into several contributions in multiorbital tight-binding models generally. In particular, we reveal that the electric dipole moment of Wannier orbitals also contributes to the orbital magnetic moment, which is not included in the conventional expression for the orbital magnetic moment in lattice systems. The derived formulation for the magnetic moment is applied to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), a phenomenon where circularly-polarized light induces a magnetic moment. To account for all possible contributions, we adopt an $s$-$p$ tight-binding system as a minimal model for studying the IFE. Using an analytical approach based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we clarify the physical origins of these contributions. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluate each contribution on an equal footing through a numerical approach based on the Floquet formalism. Our results reveal that the orbital magnetic moment exhibits a significantly larger response compared to the spin magnetic moment, with all contributions to the orbital magnetic moment being comparable in magnitude. These findings highlight the essential role of orbital degrees of freedom in the IFE.</description>

      <title>Josephson current signature of Floquet Majorana and topological accidental zero modes in altermagnet heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation and Josephson current signatures of Floquet Majorana end modes (FMEMs) in a periodically driven altermagnet (AM) heterostructure. Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW) proximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we generate both $0$- and $\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the static system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and nontopological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive can gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\pi$-FMEMs, termed as topological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via dynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover, we consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based 1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and FMEMs utilizing $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from trivial AZMs exhibiting $2\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms. This Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence of finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs in AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current response.</description>

      <title>Electrical- and magneto-transport across the thermo-elastic martensitic transformation in anti-site-disordered off-stoichiometric Co-Fe-Ti-Si Heusler alloy thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the effect of Anti-site Disorder (ASD) on electrical resistivity $\rho(T)$ and transverse magnetoresistance $MR_{\perp}$ in off-stoichiometric Co-Fe-Ti-Si (CFTS) thin films across the thermo-elastic martensitic phase transformation (MPT). The CFTS films with A2 ASD exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (n-TCR) and an upturn below $\sim 30\,$K. In sharp contrast, the partially L2$_1$-ordered films are metallic in nature, characterized by a resistivity minimum at low temperatures ($T_{\min} \cong 30\,$K) and a positive TCR for $T &gt; T_{\min}$. The change in the sign of TCR finds a straightforward explanation in terms of the competition between the quantum corrections (weak localization, electron--diffuson scattering) and the ballistic scattering mechanisms (electron--magnon and electron--phonon). We find that, stronger the atomic ASD, more prominent the quantum corrections and the weaker the scattering of $e-m$ and $e-p$ scattering. All the CFTS films exhibit a distinct thermal hysteresis and a significant drop in resistivity, symptomatic of a MPT, near the characteristic temperatures: martensite-end $T_{Me} \cong 300\,$K and austenite-begin $T_{\mathrm{Ab}} \cong 325\,$K. Regardless of the strength of ASD, in the martensite phase the anti-symmetric (ASMR) component of $\mathrm{MR}_{\perp}(H)$ dominates over the symmetric (SMR) counterpart, whereas the reverse is true (i.e. SMR $\gg$ ASMR) for the austenite phase at temperatures $T_{\mathrm{Ab}} \cong 325\,$K $\le T \le 375\,$K, where $\mathrm{MR}_{\perp}$ increases very sharply with temperature as the austenite phase grows rapidly at the expense of the martensite phase. The present results assert that the CFTS Heusler alloy thin films are promising candidates for shape-memory devices and for spintronic applications such as spin valves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.</description>

      <title>Anyon superconductivity and plateau transitions in doped fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments reported evidence of superconductivity and re-entrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) insulator upon doping the $\nu_e = 2/3$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) in twisted MoTe${}_2$, separated by narrow resistive regions. Anyons of a FQAH generally have a finite effective mass, and when described by anyon-flux composite fermions (CF), experience statistical magnetic fields with a commensurate filling. Here, we show that most of the experimental observations can be explained by invoking the effects of disorder on the Landau-Hofstadter bands of CFs. In particular, by making minimal assumptions about the anyon energetics and dispersion, we show that doping anyons drives plateau transitions of CFs into integer quantum Hall states, which physically corresponds to either to a superconductor or to a RIQAH phase. We develop a dictionary that allows us to infer the response in these phases and the critical regions from the knowledge of the response functions of the plateau transitions. In particular, this allows us to relate the superfluid stiffness of the superconductor to the polarizability of CFs. As a first step towards a quantitative understanding, we borrow results from the celebrated integer quantum Hall plateau transitions to make quantitative prediction for the critical behavior of the superfluid stiffness, longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and response to out-of-plane magnetic field, all of which agree reasonably well with the experimental observations. Our results provide strong support for anyon superconductivity being the mechanism for the observed superconductor in the vicinity of the $\nu_e = 2/3$ FQAH insulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: We show that a magnetic field parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor leads to a topological phase in coexistence with a single pair of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model</title>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Localization and splitting of a quantum droplet with a potential defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central potential barrier or well. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing potential barrier heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the potential well, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for potential barriers as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of potential wells. The presence of selective excitation processes emanating from quantum superposition in the induced droplet dynamics is explicated by evaluating the contribution of the participating single-particle eigenstates. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.</description>

      <title>Kondo-coupled van der Waals antiferromagnet with high-mobility quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising Kondo-coupled vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.</description>

Abstract: The local magnetic moments of atoms in a molecule or solid can be designated by different colors. Magnetic groups, or 2-color groups, or black-and-white groups have been applied in crystallography to classify different magnets. Despite its successes in the past decades, the recent advents of altermagnets and p-wave magnets raise new challenges to this long-standing framework, which urges for a new and unified one. Here we develop a multicolor group classification framework to classify all kinds of molecules and solids, including nonmagnetic materials and magnets with collinear or non-collinear magnetism, and with or without spin-orbit couplings (SOC). This new scheme can unify the classifications of matters into a single framework, including the recently identified altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Especially, altermagnetic topological matters and p-wave magnets with SOC, can also be diagnosed with multicolor groups, a task which can not be accomplished by magnetic space groups and spin space groups. Moreover, insufficiencies and misconceptions of conventional magnetic group classification can be supplemented through this new framework. Multicolor group will serve as a new stage in the symmetry classification of matters.</description>

      <title>Spin-triplet pairing instability in a two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Mechanically and electrically switchable triferroic altermagnet in a pentagonal FeO2 monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics promise low-power, multifunctional devices, yet the intrinsic coexistence and mutual control of three coupled ferroic orders in a single layer remains elusive. Here, we identify pentagonal monolayer FeO$_2$ as an intrinsic triferroic altermagnet where ferroelectric (FE), ferroelastic (FA), and altermagnetic (AM) orders coexist and are tightly coupled, accompanied by a competing antiferroelectric (AFE) phase using first-principles calculations. The sole presence of glide mirror $M_x$ symmetry in a FeO$_2$ sublayer, with the breaking of four-fold rotation $C_{4z}$ symmetry, induces in-plane vector ferroelectricity and twin-related ferroelastic strains. Both FE and AFE phases break combined parity - time symmetry and display sizable altermagnetic spin splitting with N\'eel temperatures over 200~K. Electric-field-induced rotation of the FE polarization reverses the sign of the spin splitting, while in-plane uniaxial strain triggers ferroelastic switching that simultaneously rotates the FE polarization vector by $90^\circ$ and reverses the AM state. These electric-field- and strain-mediated pathways interlink six distinct polarization states that can be selected purely by electric fields and/or mechanical strain. This work extends intrinsic triferroicity to pentagonal monolayers and outlines a symmetry-based route toward mechanically and electrically configurable altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet (AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials. Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the N\'eel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may be zero for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight AM-PM junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.</description>

Abstract: Spin orbit torques (SOT) are used to manipulate magnetization of ferromagnets in heavy metal / ferromagnetic bilayers and thus are technologically relevant from magnetization switching perspective. This necessitates development of methods which give an insight into SOT behaviour and enable SOT efficiency estimation. In this article, we demonstrate an experimental approach of out-of-plane (OOP) angle resolved Second Harmonic Hall (SHH) measurement, in Pt/Co and Ta/CoFeB perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) systems, for damping-like and field-like SOT efficiency estimation. This method reveals a unique anomalous field-like torque dependent on magnetization direction in Ta/CoFeB system. The damping-like and field-like SOT efficiencies are extracted by solving LLGS equation in the low frequency limit of magnetic susceptibility. Along with SHH measurements, we also experimentally demonstrate anomalous Hall effect (AHE) based spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR) technique for SOT efficiency quantification in PMA systems.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Method for Detecting Superconductivity Under High Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a contactless technique for probing superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and magnetic ordering in micron-sized samples under extreme pressure. Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200 MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core. This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently, the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$) of known superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb, and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than the $T_{\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity. Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\text{c}}$ over time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical $T_{\text{c}}$ above 0$^\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides.</description>

Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors are typically synthesized as thin films and thus include, besides the more bulk-like inner layers, distinct surface and interface layers in contact with the vacuum and substrate, respectively. Here, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to investigate how electronic correlations influence these surface and interface regions. Our results show that electronic correlations can significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers into a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover, surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\Gamma$ and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect is a time-reversal-odd phenomenon in which spin current is induced by the charge current. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling and/or noncolinear magnetism, however, spin current is not uniquely defined. Instead, we study an intrinsic response of spin to an electric field gradient that describes the spin accumulation at the boundaries of magnetic systems. We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall conductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two altermagnets (AMs) in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle $\theta$ between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM regime it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge conductivity which can be controlled by an applied gate voltage. In the strong regime, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak regime. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 13\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</description>

      <title>Universal two-stage dynamics and phase control in skyrmion formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation and establish its connection to equilibrium phases through the introduction of a chiral correlation $\chi$. Stage I involves stripe coarsening governed by the exchange-to-DMI ratio $J'$, while stage II entails stripe contraction driven by the synergy between $J'$ and the anisotropy-to-DMI ratio $K'$. The magnetic field-to-DMI ratio $B'$ influences both stages. By combining symbolic regression with neural networks, we model the competition and cooperation among these parameters and derive a skyrmion formation criterion, $0.58 K'J' + \mu B'J' &gt; 1$. Our model disentangles their distinct roles: $J'$ sets the stripe width, $K'$ primarily controls the skyrmion size, and $B'$ strongly affects the topological charge. This approach provides a general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases in chiral magnets.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and Fermi-surface expansion induced by van Hove-driven ferromagnetic fluctuations: the D-TRILEX analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the Fermi level near van Hove singularity and the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering from Ca2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-layered perovskite Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, characterized by a 4$d^4$ electron configuration, has been studied from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation, with inclusion of strong on-site Coulomb interactions and spin-orbit coupling (GGA+SO+$U$), in the framework of the fully relativistic, spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) band-structure method. This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ through the modeling of relevant spectra obtained from synchrotron-based techniques widely used to probe electronic properties, with a primary focus on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ru $L_3$ and O $K$ edges. The calculated spectra were thoroughly analyzed with available experimental data reported in the literature. The good agreement between our results and experimental observations for Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ enables a conclusive interpretation of key features in the spectra obtained from the aforementioned techniques. Consequently, this enables us to describe its electronic properties and to establish a solid theoretical approach suitable for routine modeling of spectra, particularly from RIXS, aimed at characterizing the electronic structure and properties of similar or more complex strongly correlated, technologically relevant materials.</description>
