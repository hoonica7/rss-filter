      <title>Nematic Enhancement of Superconductivity in Multilayer Graphene via Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer graphene materials have recently emerged as a fascinating versatile platform for correlated electron phenomena, hosting superconductivity, fractional quantum Hall states, and correlated insulating phases. A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring correlation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous breaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust superconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials, devices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic explanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic order to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry breaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level, producing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum metric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by the quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G. Shavit \it{et al.}, \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.176001}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 176001 (2025)}]. Our analysis reveals that nematicity naturally boosts the superconducting coupling constant in experimentally relevant density regimes, providing a compelling explanation for observed correlations. These results establish the central role of geometric effects in graphene superconductivity and highlight nematicity as a promising avenue for engineering stronger unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Field-Angle Dependence of Phonon Thermal Hall Effect in Na2X2TeO6 (X = Co, Zn)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism behind thermal Hall effects by phonons, which are observed in various materials, is not clarified despite the dominant contribution as heat carriers. Theoretically, mechanisms based on the intrinsic Berry phase and those on extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings have been proposed, which can be distinguished by comparing the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall effect and that of the magnetic anisotropy. Here, we investigate the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall effects in the antiferromagnet Na2Co2TeO6 and its non-magnetic isostructural analogue Na2Zn2TeO6 in the ac plane. We find that the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity in both materials well follows that of the out-of-plane magnetization, showing a common mechanism by extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings in both the phonon thermal Hall effect and that enhanced by a coupling with the magnetism.</description>

      <title>Bilayer graphene quantum dots as a quantum simulator of Haldane topological quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate here that a chain of Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots (BLGQD) can realize topological quantum matter by effectively simulating a spin-1 chain that hosts the Haldane phase within a specific range of parameters. We describe a chain of BLGQD with two electrons each using an atomistic tight-binding model combined with the exact diagonalization technique to solve the interacting few-electron problem. Coulomb interactions and valley mixing effects are treated within the same microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.</description>

      <title>A model for intertwined orders in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the intertwined orders in the cuprate pseudogap as a textured antiferromagnet (AFM), where the texture arises from confining competing phases on topological defects, i.e., arrays of AFM domain walls. Three branches of texture are found, which can be interpreted as a strongly frustrated remnant of an underlying eutectoid phase diagram. This model can describe many key features of intertwined orders in cuprates, including the trisected superconducting dome, and provides clear evidence for a doping/hopping-parameter-dependent Mott-Slater transition in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Valley-Selective Linear Dichroism and Excitonic Effects in Lieb-Lattice Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently been recognized as a distinct class of magnetic materials characterized by alternative spin-split electronic structures without net magnetization. Despite intensive studies on their single-particle spintronic and valleytronic properties, many-electron interactions and optical responses of altermagnets remain less explored. In this work, we employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate excited states and their strain tunability. Using monolayer Mn2WS4 as a representative candidate, we uncover a novel spin valley-dependent excitonic selection rule in two-dimensional altermagnetic Lieb lattices. In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find that linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized excitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry and electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can lift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized excitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal dichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain tunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to encode, store, and read valley/spin information.</description>

      <title>Axial Hall Effect in Altermagnetic Lieb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a so-called axial Hall effect, a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall response, in Lieb-lattice altermagnets. By constructing a tight-binding model, we identify the axial direction as a hidden topological degree of freedom. Breaking the double degeneracy of axial symmetry generates substantial Berry curvature and induces a pronounced anomalous Hall conductivity. First-principles calculations further confirm the emergence of this effect in strained altermagnets, particularly in ternary transition-metal dichalcogenides. We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall effect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading to highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of the axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the strain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom. Finally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive thickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses. These findings emphasize the critical role of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear spin textures in altermagnets, an area that has received limited attention, and open new pathways for exploring intrinsic Hall phenomena in topological magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase transitions driven by quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the quantum geometric properties of the Bloch wave function, characterized by the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance, impact magnetic phases in solid-state systems. To this end, we investigate the spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation, considering the onsite Coulomb interaction. We demonstrate that spin susceptibility can be decomposed into a trivial part, dependent solely on the band dispersion, and a geometric part, where the quantum distance plays a crucial role. Focusing on a model of a quadratic band-touching semimetal, we show that a magnetic phase transition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order can be induced solely by tuning the wavefunction geometry, even while the energy spectrum is held constant. This highlights the versatility of quantum geometry as a mechanism for tuning magnetic properties independent of the energy spectrum. Applying our framework to the Fe-pnictide and kagome lattice models, we further show that the geometric contribution is decisive in stabilizing their known antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, respectively. Our work sheds light on the hidden quantum geometric aspects necessary for understanding and engineering magnetic order in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Terahertz Response via Spin-Corner-Layer Coupling in Altermagnetic Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field control of electron charge and spin degrees of freedom is fundamental to modern semiconductor and spintronic devices. Yet controlling electromagnetic waves with an electric field, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, remains a challenge. Here, we propose a spin-corner-layer coupling (SCLC) mechanism in second-order topological altermagnetic bilayers. By using an electric field to influence electrons between different layers, the SCLC mechanism enables simultaneous control over corner and spin degrees of freedom, thereby allowing electric-field tuning of the absorption, emission intensity, and even polarization of THz waves. Taking bilayer NiZrI$_6$ nanodisks as a prototype, we demonstrate that an ultralow electrostatic field can switch both the spin and the layer polarizations of corner states. This dual switching modulates transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths between different corner states, thereby enabling the manipulation of THz waves. This study establishes a mechanism for the electric-field control of spin and THz waves through SCLC, yielding important implications for the advancement of THz spintronics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical structures in the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice: a large scale unrestricted variational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum magnet in three spatial dimension. As a close analogy of its two dimensional cousin, namely the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice(KAFH), it has long been anticipated that the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH may host a novel quantum spin liquid. However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, study of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH is limited to rather small clusters and the nature of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH. We find that the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\times2\times2$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. We also find that an nearest-neighboring(NN)-RVB ansatz with $2\times 2\times 2$ periodicity can capture very well the qualitative feature of the maximally resonating VBC state. The ground state energy obtained from the NN-RVB ansatz and the generalized RVB ansatz extrapolate to $-0.4827J/site$ and $-0.4835J/site$ respectively in the thermodynamic limit. These results, which are obtained on clusters containing as many as $N=8^{3}\times4=2048$ sites and wave function containing as many as $N_{v}=16777216$ variational parameters, constitute new benchmarks for the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Trajectory Drift and Geometric Phases of Cyclic Spinor Solitons Induced by Virtual Magnetic Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling numerically and analytically. Under the drive of a weak segmented rotational external field, we observe that the system exhibits cyclic soliton motion; however, in contrast to the predictions of quasi-particle theory, the trajectory of the soliton center shows a distinct drift. The underlying mechanism of this anomalous drift is revealed: the moving soliton experiences a Lorentz force induced by a virtual magnetic monopole field in momentum space. We further calculate the phase evolution of the soliton during this cyclic motion and find that its geometric component comprises both an adiabatic Berry phase and a nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase. Notably, the Berry phase can be expressed in terms of the magnetic flux of the aforementioned virtual monopole field. Our findings hold implications for geometric phase theory and experiments on two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and may establish a novel link between quantum geometry and soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Josephson Supercurrent in Nodeless Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range propagation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs typically occurs in ferromagnet/$s$-wave superconductor junctions, where net magnetization plays a crucial role. Here, we propose a fundamentally different scenario in which Josephson supercurrents mediated exclusively by spin-triplet pairings emerge in systems with \textit{zero} net magnetization. We identify collinear altermagnets, particularly a subclass termed nodeless altermagnets, as ideal platforms to realize this phenomenon. These materials host spin-split Fermi surfaces that do not intersect altermagnetic nodal lines and support maximal spin-valley polarization, yielding fully spin-polarized electronic states at each valley. Consequently, Josephson junctions based on nodeless altermagnets sustain supercurrents solely through spin-polarized triplet pairing correlations, simultaneously contributed by spin-up Cooper pairs from one valley and spin-down Cooper pairs from the other. Furthermore, controlling the relative local inversion-symmetry breaking at the two interfaces enables a robust 0--$\pi$ transition without fine tuning, while adjusting the junction orientation allows a crossover between pure triplet and mixed singlet-triplet states. Our work thus establishes nodeless altermagnets as a unique platform for altermagnetic superconductors with magnetization-free spin-polarized supercurrents.</description>

      <title>Fate of Topological Dirac Magnons in van der Waals Ferromagnets at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac magnons, the bosonic counterparts of Dirac fermions in graphene, provide a unique platform to explore symmetry-protected band crossings and quantum geometry in magnetic insulators, while promising high-velocity, low-dissipation spin transport for next-generation magnonic technologies. However, their stability under realistic, finite-temperature conditions remains an open question. Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of thermal magnon-magnon interactions in van der Waals honeycomb ferromagnets, focusing on both gapless and gapped Dirac magnons. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory with magnon self-energy corrections and a T-matrix resummation that captures two-magnon bound states, we quantitatively reproduce temperature- and momentum-dependent energy shifts and linewidths observed experimentally in the gapless Dirac magnon material CrBr$_3$, even near the Curie temperature. Our approach resolves discrepancies between prior theoretical predictions and experiment and highlight the significant role of bound states in enhancing magnon damping at low temperatures. For gapped Dirac magnon materials such as CrI$_3$, CrSiTe$_3$, and CrGeTe$_3$, we find a thermally induced reduction of the topological magnon gap but no evidence of thermally driven topological transitions. Classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations corroborate the gap' s robustness up to the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we establish a practical criterion for observing topological gaps by determining the minimum ratio of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to Heisenberg exchange required to overcome thermal broadening throughout the ordered phase, typically around 5%. Our results clarify the interplay of thermal many-body effects and topology in low-dimensional magnets and provide a reliable framework for interpreting spectroscopic experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent signatures of Majorana modes in thermoelectric transport through double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire and ferromagnetic leads. The study focuses on the behavior of the Seebeck coefficient and its spin-resolved counterparts, with calculations performed by means of the numerical renormalization group method. We investigate the low-temperature transport regime, where a complex interplay between the two-stage Kondo effect, the ferromagnet-induced exchange field, and the Majorana coupling occurs. We demonstrate that thermoelectric measurements can reveal unique signatures of the Majorana interaction that are challenging to isolate in conductance measurements alone. It is shown that the exchange field fundamentally alters the thermoelectric response, leading to a rich, non-monotonic temperature evolution of the thermopower, which is driven by a temperature-dependent competition between the spin channels. Furthermore, we have identified qualitatively different regimes of spin thermopower generation, controlled by the interplay between the Majorana-induced asymmetry and the spin polarization of the leads. Finally, by connecting the system's thermoelectric response to the underlying transport asymmetries quantified by the conductance spin polarization, we provide a consistent and unified physical picture, proposing thermoelectric transport as a sensitive probe for Majorana signatures.</description>

      <title>Field-free transverse Josephson diode effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that altermagnets (AMs) with Rashba spin--orbit coupling can host a transverse Josephson diode effect (TJDE) without any external magnetic field. AMs combine zero net magnetization with spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, enabling the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose a four-terminal Josephson junction where a longitudinal phase bias between opposite superconducting terminals generates transverse supercurrents in the unbiased terminals. These transverse currents exhibit both a diode-like nonreciprocity and a finite anomalous phase offset, revealing a transverse anomalous Josephson effect (AJE). For certain parameter regimes, the transverse current becomes unidirectional, and the TJDE efficiency can exceed 1000\%, demonstrating exceptionally strong diode behavior. Remarkably, the magnitude and direction of the TJDE and transverse AJE are tunable by rotating the N\'eel vector. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for engineering field-free nonreciprocal superconducting transport in multiterminal devices.</description>

      <title>From Glaphene to Glaphynes: A Hybridization of 2D Silica Glass and Graphynes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest as platforms for tailoring electronic properties through interfacial design. Very recently, a novel hybrid 2D material termed glaphene, which combines monolayers of 2D silica glass and graphene, was experimentally realized. Inspired by glaphenes, we proposed a new class of similar structures named glaphynes, which are formed by stacking SiO$_2$ monolayers onto $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-graphynes. Graphynes are 2D carbon allotropes with the presence of acetylenic groups (triple bonds). The glaphynes' structural and electronic properties were investigated using the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method, as implemented in the DFTB+ package. Our analysis confirms their energetic and structural stability. We have observed that in the case of glaphynes, the electronic proximity effect can indeed open the electronic band gap, but not for all cases, even with the formation of Si-O-C bonds between silica and graphynes.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of Berry phase estimation in topological phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berry phase is a fundamental quantity in the classification of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm and several complexity-theoretical results for the Berry phase estimation (BPE) problems. Our new quantum algorithm achieves BPE in a more general setting than previously known quantum algorithms, with a theoretical guarantee. For the complexity-theoretic results, we consider three cases. First, we prove $\mathsf{BQP}$-completeness when we are given a guiding state that has a large overlap with the ground state. This result establishes an exponential quantum speedup for estimating the Berry phase. Second, we prove $\mathsf{dUQMA}$-completeness when we have \textit{a priori} bound for ground state energy. Here, $\mathsf{dUQMA}$ is a variant of the unique witness version of $\mathsf{QMA}$ (i.e., $\mathsf{UQMA}$), which we introduce in this paper, and this class precisely captures the complexity of BPE without the known guiding state. Remarkably, this problem turned out to be the first natural problem contained in both $\mathsf{UQMA}$ and $\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{UQMA}$. Third, we show $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{dUQMA[log]}}$-hardness and containment in $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{PGQMA[log]}}$ when we have no additional assumption. These results advance the role of quantum computing in the study of topological phases of matter and provide a pathway for clarifying the connection between topological phases of matter and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Utility in Simulating the Real-time Dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model using Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is a fundamental model in condensed matter physics that describes strongly correlated electrons. On the other hand, quantum computers are emerging as powerful tools for exploring the complex dynamics of these quantum many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate the quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using IBM's superconducting quantum computers, employing over 100 qubits. We introduce a first-order Trotterization scheme and extend it to an optimized second-order Trotterization for the time evolution in the Fermi-Hubbard model, specifically tailored for the limited qubit connectivity of quantum architectures, such as IBM's platforms. Notably, both Trotterization approaches are scalable and maintain a constant circuit depth at each Trotter step, regardless of the qubit count, enabling us to precisely investigate the relaxation dynamics in the Fermi-Hubbard model by measuring the expectation value of the N\'eel observable (staggered magnetization) for time-evolved quantum states. Finally, our successful measurement of expectation values in such large-scale quantum many-body systems, especially at longer time scales with larger entanglement, highlights the quantum utility of superconducting quantum platforms over conventional classical approximation methods.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Quantum Breakdown Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a bosonic quantum breakdown Hubbard model, which generalizes the Bose-Hubbard model by adding an asymmetric breakdown interaction turning one boson into two between adjacent sites. When the normal hopping is zero, this model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, and we show that the ground state undergoes a first-order phase transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a spontaneously symmetry breaking (SSB) breakdown condensate as the breakdown interaction increases. Surprisingly, the SSB breakdown condensate does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable SSB in one dimension. Moreover, we show that the quench dynamics of a boson added to MI exhibits a dynamical transition from dielectric to breakdown phases, which happens at a larger breakdown interaction than the ground state phase transition. Between these two transitions, the MI (dielectric) state is a false vacuum stable against dynamical breakdown. Our results reveal that quantum models with unconventional symmetries such as the exponential symmetry can exhibit unexpected properties.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic phonon self-energy due to electrons with finite linewidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the non-adiabatic phonon self-energy arising from coupling to electrons with finite linewidths using the spectral representation of Green's functions. Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from the intra-band electronic transitions (as well as the inter-band ones) at all electron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for zone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a proof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the double-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a function of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained with finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with infinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures. Intra-band electronic transitions play an important role in making this difference. Moreover, only the results accounting for the finite electron linewidths are in quantitative agreement with the available experimental data. The presented formalism is suitable for first-principles calculations.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism has surfaced as a novel magnetic phase, bridging the properties of ferro- and anti-ferromagnetism. The momentum-dependent spin-splitting observed in these materials reflects their unique symmetry characteristics, which also establish the conditions for chiral magnons to emerge. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence for a chiral magnon in the altermagnetic candidate MnTe revealed by circular-dichroism resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (CD-RIXS). This mode which we term chiral altermagnon exhibits a distinct momentum dependence of its spin polarization consistent with the proposed altermagnetic $g-$wave symmetry of MnTe. Our polarization-resolved results corroborate the existence of a new class of magnetic excitations, demonstrating how altermagnetic order shapes spin dynamics and paves the way for advances in spintronic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Hyperpolarizability of Crystals with Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor as a necessary element in the geometric classification of nonlinear responses and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconducting states in multilayer rhombohedral graphene with spin and valley polarization has raised an interesting question: how does superconductivity cope with time-reversal symmetry breaking? In this work, using Ginzburg-Landau theory and microscopic calculation, we predict the existence of a new superconducting state at low electron density, which exhibits a spontaneously formed lattice of vortices and antivortices hosting Majorana zero-modes in their cores. We further identify this vortex-antivortex lattice (VAL) state in the experimental phase diagram and describe its experimental manifestations.</description>

      <title>Relation of Continuous Chirality Measure to Spin and Orbital Polarization, and Chiroptical Properties in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality introduces intriguing topological, electronic, and spin-optronic properties to molecules and solids. In this work, we provide a quantitative metric for the degree of chirality in solids, independent of the type of system and the dimensionality, through the continuous chirality measure (CCM). We quantitatively analyze the correlation between CCM and spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization, as well as circular dichroism (CD) and the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). By internal spin-orbit field analysis, we demonstrate a distinct character (proportionality among Rashba, Deresselhaus, and Weyl contributions) and chirality dependence among different chiral solids. Furthermore, unlike CD, we found that absorption dissymmetry factor $g_{CD}$ could remain unchanged as a function of chirality and show anisotropic dependence on CCM. In addition, we show that the relation between CCM and CPGE is rather complex. At low excitation energy close to the bandgap transition, the CCM continuously tunes the total SOC, and therefore, the CPGE response. However, at high excitation energy, CPGE includes more than just band edge transitions, which complicates the relation of chirality and CPGE due to changes in the optical dipole strength and electron-hole group velocity difference. Ultimately, this causes CPGE to be only correlated with chirality at excitation energies close to the band edge. At the end, we discussed strategies of manipulating chiral-optical properties through chirality transfer at interfaces or applying strain. The insights developed in this work will inspire the design of materials for future spintronics and orbitronics, as well as spin-optronics applications.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in harnessing non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics. A key requirement for their practical use is the ability to control the spin order in a reliable and tunable manner. In this work, we investigate how the spin order in kagome antiferromagnets -- an important class of NCAFMs -- can be manipulated via strain. Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive an effective action for the kagome antiferromagnet that captures the coupling between the spin order and the system's strain tensor. At the microscopic level, this coupling arises from strain-induced modifications of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and exchange interactions. Using this effective description, we explore two strain-driven phenomena: (1) strain-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic spin order and (2) the piezomagnetic response. We numerically show that strain facilitates thermally assisted switching between spin configurations of opposite chirality. Specifically, we find that uniform tensile and compressive strain govern both the average switching time and the preferred switching direction between chiral states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strain induces a net magnetization and provide an experimentally testable prediction of this effect for a typical NCAFM. Our results provide a theoretical framework for modeling strain-induced manipulation of kagome antiferromagnets, underscoring strain as a promising route for functional control of NCAFMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field is well known. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene, which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit analytical expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an analytic slave boson method for treating the finite $U$ Anderson impurity model. Our approach introduces two bosons to track both $Q\rightleftharpoons Q\pm1$ valence fluctuations and reduces to a single symmetric $s$-boson in the effective action, encoding all the high energy atomic physics information in the boson's kinematics, while the low energy part of the action remains unchanged across finite $U$, infinite $U$, and Kondo limits. We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for the single impurity Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Demystifying quantum escapism on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the magnetic landscape of easily-exfoliable two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fixed lines of $S=1/2$ XXZ chain with next-nearest neighbor interaction and $sl_2$ loop algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin systems are important to understand various physical properties in quantum many-body systems. We numerically study the Gaussian fixed lines (GFLs) of the $S=1/2$ XXZ chain with next-nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction in the XY phase. The GFLs are the set of points where the coefficient of the umklapp scattering vanishes. We show that the GFLs pass through the ``special points'', which are defined as the points where the $sl_2$ loop algebra symmetry governs in low-energy physics. In addition, we have discussed the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter K, and the metamagnetism influences the shape of the GFLs.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.</description>
