      <title>High-order coupling as a driver for Mott insulating behavior in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The numerical reliability is confirmed by the agreement between zero-frequency AC and DC conductivities.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering Magnetism and Superconductivity in the Square-Lattice Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in the square-lattice Hubbard model under periodic driving with circularly polarized light. Formulating diagrammatic techniques based on the random-phase approximation in terms of Floquet Green's functions, allows us to analyze fluctuation-driven unconventional pairing for weak-to-moderate interactions. The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic crossover prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Layer breathing Raman mode in two-dimensional van der Waals material $\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials have emerged as key materials for next-generation magneto-electric and spintronic devices, where understanding the relationship between layer number, lattice dynamics, and magnetic interactions is very important. In this work, we report the observation of the layer breathing mode (LBM) in few-layer $\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$, a ferromagnetic semiconductor with thickness dependent electronic, magnetic and optical properties, using Raman spectroscopy, which serves as a direct fingerprint of interlayer coupling and lattice symmetry. Group-theoretical symmetry analysis confirms that the CGT falls under the non-polar category of layered material. The evolution of the LBM-frequency with increasing layer number (N) reveals a distinct softening trend, characteristic of weakening restoring forces in thicker flakes. By fitting the experimental Raman data using the Linear Chain Model (LCM), we quantitatively extract the interlayer force constant ($\mathrm{K_c}$), providing a measure of the vdW coupling strength between layers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a field on the Tasaki square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice (flat-band spin system) and study its low-temperature thermodynamics around the saturation magnetic field. To this end, we construct a mapping of the ground states in the subspaces with total $S^z=N/2,\ldots,N/3$ ($N$ is the number of lattice sites) on the hard squares on an auxiliary square lattice and use classical Monte Carlo simulations to examine the latter classical system. The most prominent feature of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice is an order-disorder phase transition which occurs at a low temperature just below the saturation magnetic field and belongs to the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupled periodic Anderson model: Kondo-Dirac semimetal and orbital-selective antiferromagnetic semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the periodic Anderson model composed of an itinerant $c$-band and a strongly localized $f$-band, featuring on-site electron-electron interactions in the $f$-orbitals. The two bands interact via a hybridization term with spin-orbit coupling, which enables spin-flip processes. In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones. We establish that spin-orbit coupling in the hybridization term gives rise to Dirac cones, which, combined with additional symmetry-breaking conditions, can generate novel topological states.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulators Transition in Non-ideal Flat Bands of Twisted Mono-bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal $|C|&gt;1$ flat bands can be viewed as color-entangled composites of $C$ lowest Landau levels, but in realistic moir\'e systems non-ideal quantum geometry complicates this picture, leaving their stabilization mechanism incompletely understood. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $\kappa$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $\kappa$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry and Phase Control in K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ via Self-Flux Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered delafossite-type magnetic materials, such as KCrSe$_2$, are promising platforms for studying magnetic systems and potential frustration on triangular lattices. Synthesis, structure-type control, and off-stoichiometries remain major challenges in the investigation of these delafossite-type magnets. Starting from the same self-flux composition (K:Cr:Se = 8:1:8), we isolated three distinct K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ phases with $x$ = 0, 0.13--0.17, and 0.32--0.35, each adopting a different structure type depending on the quenching temperature applied. The phase evolution indicates a sequence of transformations during synthesis between compounds with varying degrees of potassium deficiency. Building on these insights into phase stability and crystal growth, we successfully grew single crystals of full-stoichiometric KCrSe$_2$ -- enabling direction-dependent magnetization measurements. These measurements reveal a pronounced field dependence of the N\'{e}el temperature at low external fields, as well as a weak metamagnetic transition. Our findings demonstrate that even a simple parameter -- such as quenching temperature -- can be used to control stoichiometry, direct phase formation, and ultimately tune the magnetic properties of delafossite-type materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Valley Transport in Bilayer Graphene Induced by Interlayer Sliding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer sliding, together with twist angle, is a crucial parameter that defines the atomic registry and thus determines the properties of two-dimensional (2D) material homobilayers. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that controlled interlayer sliding in bilayer graphene induces Berry curvature reversals, leading to topological states confined within a one-dimensional moir\'e channel. We experimentally realize interlayer sliding by bending the bilayer graphene geometry across a nanoridge. Systematic electronic transport measurements reveal topological valley transport when the Fermi energy resides within the band gap, consistent with theoretical predictions of eight topological channels. Our findings establish interlayer sliding as a powerful tool for tuning the electronic properties of bilayer graphene and underscore its potential for broad application across 2D material systems.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis of Competing Correlations in Quarter-Filled Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven analysis of correlation hierarchies in the quarter-filled simple and extended Hubbard models by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to exact-diagonalization (ED) data on 3x4 and 4x4 cylindrical clusters. While the non-interacting limit (U=0) provides a finite-size reference, increasing on-site repulsion U induces localization and reorganizes the low-energy spectrum. For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Luttinger liquid and correlated insulating states in one-dimensional moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e superlattices have been extensively studied, and a variety of correlated phenomena have been observed. However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moir\'e superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moir\'e superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.</description>

      <title>Giant number-parity effect and scalable spin squeezing in Luttinger liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-size quantum spin systems can be magnetized by the application of a symmetry-breaking field, but in general their symmetry is expected to be restored once the field is turned off adiabatically. Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $\xi_R^2 \sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>XPS Analysis of Surface Chemical Transformations in ZBLAN Glass under Thermal and Vibrational Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZBLAN glass is highly sensitive to thermal and mechanical stimuli, yet the associated surface chemical changes remain poorly understood. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on multiple ZBLAN samples representing distinct structural states: fully amorphous, incipiently crystalline, and highly crystalline, produced through thermal treatments at 250C and 350C and vibration-assisted processing at 400C under low (L2) and high (H5) vibration levels. High-resolution F 1s, Zr 3d, Hf 4f, Ba 3d, La 3d, and Na 1s spectra show progressive peak sharpening and intensity enhancement with increasing temperature and vibration, indicating reduced surface disorder and greater local structural ordering. The most pronounced changes occur under high vibration at 400C. No binding-energy shifts were detected, confirming that all elements retain their expected oxidation states and that the observed evolution reflects structural rather than chemical changes. These results provide direct evidence that thermomechanical input enhances surface ordering in ZBLAN and clarify its role in crystallization behavior relevant to infrared optical applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbon embedded in h-BN lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-P\'erot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 {\Omega}, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit driven $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism in a d$^7$ triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental advances have identified cobaltates with a high-spin $d^7$ electronic configuration as promising hosts for spin-orbit entangled $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism that can support bond-dependent exchange interactions. In two-dimensional triangular lattices, the coexistence of such exchange frustration along with geometric frustration gives rise to a rich landscape of competing magnetic phases, establishing monolayer triangular $d^7$ cobaltates as a compelling platform for frustrated magnetism. Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework. We construct the first and third nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange dependent $J_1$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram in the physically relevant regime and identify multiple competing ground states, including ferromagnetic, stripy, spiral, and $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic orders. The Luttinger-Tisza analysis further predicts a Z$_2$ vortex crystal phase, while exact diagonalization reveals a bond-nematic phase stabilized by the longer-range couplings. Going beyond the conventional bond-independent XXZ picture typically applied to Co$^{2+}$ systems, our results on monolayer CoBr$_2$ establish d$^7$ cobalt dihalides as a promising platform to explore the interplay of long-range Heisenberg and bond-dependent exchange interactions that can stabilize diverse magnetic ground states on a triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial flat bands and quantum Hall crossovers in square-octagon lattice materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coexistence of nontrivial topology and flat electronic bands in low-energy lattices provides a fertile platform for correlated quantum states. The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $\alpha$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced superconductivity in LaP2 with graphenelike phosphorus layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with graphene-like layers attract tremendous attention due to their electronic structures and superconducting properties. In this study, we synthesized LaP2 polycrystalline and observed a superconducting transition around 30 GPa. The critical temperature Tc increases monotonically with pressure, which is nearing saturation and reaches 7.8 K at 78 GPa. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the superconducting transition originates from a structure transition to the P6/mmm phase under high pressure, suggesting the observation of graphene-like phosphorus layers in transition metal phosphides. By first-principles calculations, we provide more evidence for the stability of the graphene-like phosphorus layers in LaP2. Our findings are helpful for the understanding of the LaP2 phase diagram under high pressure, and could shed light on the research of unique structures in transition metal phosphides under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Spin Accumulation based deep MOKE Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic imaging techniques are widespread critical tools used in fields such as magnetism, spintronics or even superconductivity. Among them, one of the most versatile methods is the magneto-optical Kerr effect. However, as soon as light is blocked from interacting with the magnetic layer, such as in deeply buried layers, optical techniques become ineffective. In this work, we present a spin-accumulation based magneto-optical Kerr effect (SA-MOKE) microscopy technique that enables imaging of a magnetic thin-films covered by thick and opaque metallic layers. The technique is based on the generation and detection of transient spin-accumulations that propagate through the thick metallic layer. These spin-accumulation signals are directly triggered and detected optically on the same side, lifting any substrate transparency requirements. The spin-accumulation signals detected on a Cu layer decay with a characteristic length of 60 nm, much longer than the 12 nm optical penetration depth, allowing for detection of magnetic contrast with Cu capping layers up to hundreds of nm. This method should enable magnetic imaging in a wide-range of experiments where the surface of interest is covered by electrodes.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Next-Nearest-Neighbor Hopping on the Low-Dimensional Hubbard Model: Ferromagnetism, Antiferromagnetism, and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model has attracted considerable interest due to its prototypical role in describing strongly interacting electronic systems, such as high-critical-temperature superconductors as well as many novel quantum materials. By introducing next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings to the Hubbard model, the phase diagram becomes richer, and fascinating phenomena arise in both, one-dimensional chains and square lattices, such as: antiferromagnetism (AFM), ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity (SC), as well as charge orders, among others. Moreover, NNN hoppings play a fundamental role in understanding effects of doping on magnetism and pairing orders in strongly interacting regimes. In this article, we review the recent progress in understanding the different competing phases of this model in one and two dimensions from a computational perspective. We comment on the pressing technical challenges, illustrate the controversial results concerning the emergence of the SC phase, and conclude with our perspectives on future explorations.</description>

      <title>A High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

      <title>Survival of Hermitian Criticality in the Non-Hermitian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional anisotropic XY model subject to a complex-valued transverse field. Within the biorthogonal framework, we calculate the ground-state correlation functions and entanglement entropy, confirming that their scaling behavior remains identical to that in the Hermitian XY model. The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP). Given that non-Hermitian systems are inherently open, this research opens a new avenue for exploring conventional quantum phase transitions that are typically vulnerable to decoherence and environmental disruption in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dynamics of Charged Graphene Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dissipative dynamics in a graphene-based quantum battery modeled as a four level spin valley system. The battery is charged via a Gaussian pulse and subsequently evolves under amplitude damping, dephasing, and both Markovian and non Markovian reservoirs. We find that amplitude damping, while inducing energy loss, can stabilize non passive steady states with finite ergotropy, whereas pure dephasing suppresses coherence and eliminates work extraction. On the other hand, non-Markovian memory slows ergotropy loss and enables partial recovery through information backflow. These results identify coherence and reservoir memory as essential resources for enhancing the long-time performance of graphene quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Orientations of Orbi-K-Theory measuring Topological Phases and Brane Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Chern phases of quantum materials, as well as brane charges on M-theory orbifolds, have famously been argued to be classified by (orbi) topological K-theory, or possibly by other stable and, notably, complex-oriented cohomology theories, such as elliptic cohomology or Morava K-theory.
  However, closer inspection reveals that the most fine-grained "fragile" microscopic classification in both cases is in (orbi) Cohomotopy, which is the primordial "unstable" or nonabelian generalized cohomology. Coarsening takes the latter (fragile) to the former (stable) cohomology along an nonabelian cohomology operations. But what then is the role of complex orientation on the stable side?
  We observe here (i) that over gapped nodal lines in the 2D Brillouin torus and on probe M5-branes in 11D spacetime, the cohomotopical phases/charges lift through the complex/quaternionic Hopf fibration, and (ii) that measuring this fragile situation in stable cohomology means equivalently to ask for universal complex/quaternionic orientation on stable cohomology in four/ten dimensions!
  Then we give an explicit realization of such unstable four/ten-dimensional complex/quaternionic orientation in U(2)/Sp(2)-equivariant K-theory, using real division-algebraic tools within a new model of twisted orbifold K-theory in cohesive homotopy theory; and we explain this as an extraordinary character map from orbi Cohomotopy-twisted Cohomotopy to relative orbi K-theory.
  Finally, we discuss an application to the classification of 2-band crystalline topological insulator phases sensitive to the topology in the gapping process of their nodal line semimetal parent phase, and to the measurement of M-string charges inside M5-brane probes.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Attosecond Control of Solid-State Harmonics by Optical Waveforms and Quantum Geometry Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: The consecutive magnetic ordering of the Ho and Ru ions in the pyrochlore Ho2Ru2O7 and their interplay are investigated by neutron scattering, magnetic and specific heat measurements. The Ru moments order at 95 K into a $\Gamma_5$ easy-plane antiferromagnetic state. At 1.55 K the Ho moments order into an unusual $\Gamma_9$ ferromagnetic state with extensive ground state entropy and structured spin dynamics. It is shown how the internal fields with $\Gamma_5$ and $\Gamma_9$ geometry allow for two symmetry breaking transitions. The lower temperature ordering is driven by ruthenium mediated interactions between holmium moments as spin ice correlations develop. The unsaturated order is compatible with a fragmented ferromagnetic state equivalent to pyrochlore kagome ice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of excitonic Mott phases in the presence of a periodic potential and a non-local exciton-exciton interaction. The non-local interaction is treated in a mean-field approximation, while the local repulsion of the excitons is treated in a hopping expansion. The convergence of the latter is the criterion for the stability of the Mott phase with respect to quantum and thermal fluctuations. This hybrid approach enables us to establish a phase diagram for a bosonic Mott to superfluid transition. Our results could be useful to interpret recent experiments on electron-hole crystals in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} &gt; 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>An Optimally Accurate Lanczos Algorithm in the Matrix Product State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent studies on quantum materials where transition-metal atoms give rise to $d$-bands typical of kagome metals. Using examples from several material families - AV$_3$Sb$_5$, FeGe, RV$_6$Sn$_6$, and LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ - we argue that $p$-bands contributed by elements beyond the kagome network also play a crucial role in the electronic instabilities, including the charge-density-waves and superconductivity in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Ordered buckling structures in a twisted crimped tube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a ribbon or tube is twisted far enough it forms buckles and wrinkles. Its new geometry can be strikingly ordered, or hopelessly disordered. Here we study this process in a tube with hybrid boundary conditions: one end a cylinder, and the other end crimped flat like a ribbon, so that the sample resembles a toothpaste tube. The resulting irregular structures and mechanical responses can be dramatically different from those of a ribbon. However, when we form two creases in the tube prior to twisting, we obtain an ordered structure composed of repeating triangular facets oriented at varying angles, and a more elastic torque response, reminiscent of the creased helicoid structure of a twisted ribbon. We measure how the torque and structural evolution depend on parameters such as material thickness and the twist angle. When only part of the tube is pre-creased, the ordered structures are confined to this segment. Surprisingly, in some tubes made from thicker sheets, an ordered structure forms without pre-creasing. This study provides insights into controlling the buckling of thin shells, offering a potential pathway for designing ordered structures in soft materials.</description>

      <title>Interaction-enhanced quantum to classical transport crossover temperature in a Luttinger liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strange metals are highly entangled gapless states of matter that exhibit anomalous transport, such as linear in temperature resistivity, over more than a decade of temperature. Why a single power law should be so robust is an open question. We propose a scenario in which interactions enhance the domain of certain scattering regimes, effectively suppressing other ``would-be regimes." We test this proposal in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid coupled to a one-dimensional acoustic phonon. We use the memory matrix formalism to calculate the dc electrical and thermal conductivities at low and high temperatures, relative to the Debye cutoff on phonon frequencies, in both the ``clean" (umklapp scattering) and ``dirty" (disorder scattering) limits. We find the crossover temperature separating the low and high temperature regimes to be interaction-dependent, with repulsive interactions substantially increasing it, generally by more than an order of magnitude. This provides a concrete illustration for how interactions can extend a single transport regime over a wider temperature range.</description>

      <title>Spin-chirality-dependent modulation of topological gap, Chern number, and valley-polarization in monolayer kagome lattice Cr3Se4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin-chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization (\k{appa} = 0) or spin-chirality \k{appa} = -1, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. Conversely, increasing the polar angle enhances the bandgap for \k{appa} = 1. In the breathing kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted. As the gap undergoes sequential closure and reopening in the two valleys, the structural asymmetry and spin-chirality allow for controlled tuning of the topological gap, Chern number, and valley polarization. Moreover, the emergence of a topological Hall effect is is also demonstrated. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.</description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions Controlled by Tunable Metastability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of thermal fluctuations on the morphology of two-dimensional materials are hard to harness. We propose that a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon (GNR) can exhibit thermally activated snap-through transitions with a predictable and controllable transition rate constant. The energetics and kinetics of such transitions can be fully captured by combining enhanced sampling methods and generalized transition state theory. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we determine the free energy landscape and a pair of asymmetric transition pathways of the GNR system. Notably, generalized transition state theory accurately captures how the transition rate constant responds to temperature and the tunable free energy landscape of our system. This work offers a theoretical framework for elastic metastability, introduces rare event methods into thermalized nanomechanical systems, and provides potential applications in designing nanoscale thermal switches and thermal actuators.</description>

      <title>Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.</description>

      <title>Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons of $d$-symmetry interacting with a localized non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin order on a kagome lattice are considered. Even in the absence of an external magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling or relativistic effects, the spin texture produces a non-trivial intrinsic Berry curvature. This opens the route for a quantum anomalous Hall effect in the $d$-system. For spin orders with an out-of-plane component, the scalar spin chirality is finite, and the integration of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone may yield integer Hall conductivities in units of $e^2/h$. This canted configuration gives rise to the maximal possible Chern number, $C=\pm 5$ when the Fermi level is within nontrivial gap. The effect is best understood for -- but not limited to -- isotropic $d$-electron hopping and degenerate $d$-levels. In this case, analytic expressions are available and point to a topological origin for the manifestation of the maximal $C$. Numerical calculations show that these findings are robust to some anisotropy in the hopping integrals and to moderate splittings of the $d$ levels. The $C=\pm 5$ plateau can be split into Chern peaks with smaller integers by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transition between Hall plateaus of opposite $C$ can be driven by flipping the out-of-plane component of the spin order, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.</description>

      <title>Dark Soliton Formation as a Dark-State Phase Transition in a Dissipative Superfluid Josephson Junction Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify and characterize a first-order dark-state phase transition between a discrete dark soliton and a uniform superfluid in a Bose-Hubbard chain with a single lossy site. Using classical-field (truncated-Wigner) simulations together with a Bogoliubov stability analysis, we show that the dark-state nature of the soliton suppresses fluctuations and shifts the critical point relative to the comparable phenomenon of optical bistability in driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. We then demonstrate that this mechanism quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 235302 (2016)], resolving substantial discrepancies in prior modeling efforts. Our results reveal how driving, dissipation and quantum coherence can interact to induce nonequilibrium phase transitions in ultra-cold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons in single-layer graphene for transport applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nanoscale single-layer graphene-based devices, valley-dependent topological physics may be exploited in device design. To demonstrate the point, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of single-layer graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is presented with respect to configurational fluctuations. Last, a proof-of-concept electron energy band-stop filter is illustrated, highlighting the potential of the foregoing confinement and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale single-layer graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) remains one of the central problems in correlated moir\'e materials. The most intriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair formed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point out the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets, dubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\nu=-2-x$, there is a two-component picture: two electrons mainly localize at each AA site and form a paired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon, while additional holes doped into the AA sites form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to an intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and is topologically distinct to the conventional Fermi liquid. We develop a unified framework to describe both a renormalized FL phase and an sFL phase. We propose that the TBG superconductor emerges from the sFL phase, but is close to the transition toward the FL phase under increasing hole doping. In the superconductor, pairing of local moments is shared to the mobile carriers and a smaller superconducting gap with nodal $p_x$ symmetry is opened on the small hole pockets. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified theory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap nematic superconductivity below it.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.</description>
