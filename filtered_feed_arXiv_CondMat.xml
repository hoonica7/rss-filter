      <title>Superconductivity and Ferroelectric Orbital Magnetism in Semimetallic Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum phases, enabled by its Berry-curvature-bearing flat bands. While prior work has focused on separated conduction and valence bands, we probe the extensive semimetallic regime of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. We survey a rich phase diagram dominated by flavor-symmetry breaking and reveal an electric-field-driven band inversion through fermiology. Near this inversion, we find a superconducting-like state confined to a region with emergent electron and hole Fermi surfaces. In addition, two multiferroic orbital-magnetic phases are observed: a ferrovalley state near zero field and a ferroelectric state at large fields around charge neutrality. The latter shows electric-field-reversible magnetic hysteresis, consistent with a $\Delta P \cdot M$ multiferroic order parameter. Our fermiology analysis elucidates the correlated semimetal regime in rhombohedral graphene and underscores its potential to host diverse quantum phases.</description>

      <title>A simulation-based training framework for machine-learning applications in ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models.</description>

      <title>Strong Correlation Driven Quadrupolar to Dipolar Exciton Transitions in a Trilayer Moir\'e Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The additional layer degree of freedom in trilayer moir\'e superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenides enables the emergence of novel excitonic species, such as quadrupolar excitons, which exhibit unique excitonic interactions and hold promise for realizing intriguing excitonic phases and their quantum phase transitions. Concurrently, the presence of strong electronic correlations in moir\'e superlattices, as exemplified by the observations of Mott insulators and generalized Wigner crystals, offers a direct route to manipulate these new excitonic states and resulting collective excitonic phases. Here, we demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton and electron-exciton interactions, both stemming from robust electron correlations, can be harnessed to controllably drive transitions between quadrupolar and dipolar excitons. This is achieved by tuning either the exciton density or electrostatic doping in a trilayer semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of quadrupolar excitons but also usher in new avenues for exploring and engineering many-body quantum phenomena through novel correlated excitons in semiconducting moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Thermomodulated intrinsic Josephson effect in Kagome CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting chiral domains associated with a time-reversal symmetry-breaking order parameter have garnered significant attention in Kagome systems. In this work, we demonstrate both the intrinsic direct-current and alternating-current Josephson effects in the nanoplates of the vanadium-based Kagome material CsV3Sb5, as evidenced by Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps. Moreover, both the Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps are modulated by thermal cycling, suggesting that the Josephson effects arise from dynamic superconducting domains. These findings may provide new insights into chiral superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 and highlight the potential of these intrinsic Josephson junctions for applications in chiral superconductor based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Laser-Induced Magnetic Relaxation in Artificial Spin Ice Driven by Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is of great interest to develop methods to rapidly and effectively control the magnetic configurations in artificial spin ices, which are arrangements of dipolar coupled nanomagnets that have a variety of fascinating collective magnetic phenomena associated with them. This is not only valuable in terms of acquiring fundamental understanding but is also important for future high-performance applications. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast control of magnetic relaxation in square artificial spin ice through femtosecond laser pulsed excitation, enabling rapid access to low-energy states via dipolar interactions. Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that, after laser-induced demagnetization, the magnetization recovers within picoseconds. During this brief transient window, dipolar coupling drives a collective magnetic ordering. Ex-situ magnetic force microscopy confirms the emergence of extended Type I vertex domains, characteristic of ground-state ordering, thus establishing ultrafast laser-driven relaxation as a route to attain the low-energy states. Through complementary energy barrier calculations and micromagnetic simulations incorporating Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch dynamics, we elucidate the underlying mechanism: transient ultrafast demagnetization followed by rapid remagnetization that enables a dipolar-driven collective rearrangement. Moreover, a tailored decreasing-fluence laser annealing protocol is shown to enhance ground-state ordering, consistently achieving over 92% ground-state vertex populations. This work opens the way to ultrafast and spatially selective control of magnetic states in artificial spin ice for spin-based computation and memory technologies, and highlights the critical interplay of thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic coupling, and transient magnetization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magneto-conductivity and CME in Dirac semimetals from Keldysh technique in Landau levels basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is conventionally considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME), by means of a postulated Chiral Kinetic equation. In this paper we study magnetoconductivity in large Fermi energy Dirac semimetals, in one of which (ZrTe$_5$) the effect was observed for the first time. Starting with a Hamiltonian for a semi-realistic model of such a Dirac semimetal, we apply the Non-equilibrium Diagram Technique (NDT, or the Keldysh technique) to derive the kinetic equations, to investigate the electrons relaxation due to interaction with phonons and disorder, and, finally, to calculate the DC magnetoconductivity (the longitudinal to magnetic field component of conductivity) as a function of magnetic field strength and temperature. Finally, we compare the obtained temperature dependencies with available to us experimental data.</description>

      <title>Extreme magnetic field-boosted superconductivity in a high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity through Pauli and orbital limiting effects. However, there are rare instances of magnetic-field-induced superconductivity, as seen in Chevrel phase compounds [1], organic conductors [2], uranium-based heavy-fermion systems [3, 4], and moire graphene [5], though these materials possess inherently low superconducting transition temperatures (Tc). Here, we demonstrate high field-stabilized superconductivity in a class of materials with a significantly higher Tc (up to 40 K): the infinite-layer nickelates [6]. Both low-field and high-field superconducting states can be plausibly explained by a compensation mechanism akin to the Jaccarino-Peter effect. These findings demonstrate the possibility of achieving substantially enhanced upper critical fields in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Reinforcement of Graphene via Wrinkling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical cantilevers are central to nanotechnology, with ultimate sensitivity achieved at the atomic limit, where low bending rigidity makes stability the fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce a wrinkle-induced stiffening approach that enhances the bending rigidity of monolayer graphene by several orders of magnitude, enabling the fabrication of mechanically robust graphene cantilevers. When suspended over microcavities, these wrinkled membranes exhibit significant increases in both in-plane and out-of-plane stiffness, as confirmed by nanoindentation and resonance measurements, which also reveal that enhanced bending rigidity strongly influences their vibrational response. This behavior marks a transition from tension-dominated mechanics to a regime where bending effects become prominent, even in a single atomic layer. By sculpting these structures, we realize graphene cantilevers with measured bending rigidities between $10^6$ and $10^7$ eV, while maintaining femtogram-scale mass. These findings open new directions in nanomechanical sensing and cantilever-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer empties the flat band in 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ -- except at the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4H\textsubscript{b} polytype of TaS$_2$ is a natural heterostructure of H and T-type layers. Intriguing recent evidence points towards a possibly chiral superconducting ground state, unlike the superconductivity found in other polytypes where the T layers are absent, requiring understanding of the possible contributions of electrons from the T layers. Here we use micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal that the T termination of the 4H\textsubscript{b} structure is metallic, but a subsurface T layer -- seen below an H termination and thus more representative of the bulk case -- is gapped. The results imply a complete charge transfer of 1 electron per 13 Ta from the T to adjacent H layers in the bulk, but an incomplete charge transfer at the T termination, yielding a metallic Fermi surface with a planar-chiral character. A similar metallic state is found in an anomalous region with likely T-H-H' stacking at the surface. Our results exclude cluster Mott localisation in either the bulk or surface of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and point to a scenario of superconductivity arising from Josephson-like tunneling between the H layers.</description>

      <title>Getting the manifold right: The crucial role of orbital resolution in DFT+U for mixed d-f electron compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling compounds with partially filled $d$ and $f$ shells remains a hard challenge for density-functional theory, due to large self-interaction errors stemming from local or semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Hubbard $U$ corrections can mitigate such errors, but are often detrimental to the description of hybridized states, leading to spurious force contributions and wrong lattice structures. Here, we show that careful disentanglement of localized and delocalized states leads to accurate predictions of electronic states and structural distortions in ternary monouranates (AUO$_4$, where A represents Mn, Co, or Ni), for which standard $U$ corrections generally fail. Crucial to achieving such accuracy is a minimization of the mismatch between the spatial extension of the projector functions and the true coordination geometry. This requires Wannier-like alternatives to atomic-orbital projector functions, or corrections of Hubbard manifolds exclusively comprised of the most localized A-$3d$, U-$5f$ and O-$2p$ orbitals. These findings open up the computational prediction of fundamental properties of actinide solids of critical technological importance.</description>

      <title>Tracking flat bands via phonon-mediated interband scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band (FB) materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phases. While numerous candidates have recently been identified through spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, central challenges remain on how to tune FBs towards the Fermi level $E_F$ and to understand their impact on low-energy excitations probed in electronic transport experiments. Here, we show that, by attributing the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures to electron-phonon interband scattering, one can infer the position of FBs near $E_F$ across diverse material classes. As charge carriers scatter off phonons, interband transitions into FB states lead to distinctive sub- or superlinear resistivity at elevated temperatures, governed by the proximity of the FB to $E_F$. Our phenomenological model captures these universal transport behaviors observed across several recently studied FB compounds and offers a simple, broadly applicable method for detecting flat bands.</description>

      <title>Chiral charge density wave in 4Hb- and 1T-TaS$_2$: The Role of interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (micro-ARPES) to investigate chiral charge density waves (CDWs) in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the 1T layers of 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we uncover coexisting left- and right-handed CDW domains and resolve four distinct spectral patterns arising from the interplay of chirality and rotational stacking. In contrast, bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits a uniform chirality. In addition, 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shows negligible out-of-plane dispersion of the 1T-derived bands, in contrast to the pronounced interlayer coupling observed in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this picture, revealing that the interlayer interaction of the chiral order in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is nearly two orders of magnitude weaker than in the 1T polytype. Our findings establish 4Hb-TaS$_2$ as a quasi-two-dimensional platform for exploring tunable chiral CDW phenomena.</description>

      <title>From strong to weak correlations in breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials: Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$ as a robust and versatile platform for many-body engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining ab initio downfolding with cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we study the degree of correlations in monolayer, bilayer and bulk breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$. Our new material-specific many-body model library shows that in low-temperature bulk structures the Coulomb correlation strength steadily increases from I to F, allowing us to identify Nb$_3$I$_8$ as a weakly correlated insulator, Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as strongly correlated insulators, and Nb$_3$F$_8$ as a prototypical bulk Mott-insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements comparing Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$I$_8$ allow us to experimentally confirm these findings by revealing spectroscopic footprints of the degree of correlation. Our calculations uncover how the thickness and the stacking affect the degree of correlations and predict that the entire material family can be tuned into correlated charge-transfer or Mott-insulating phases upon doping. Our magnetic property analysis based on our model parameter library additionally confirms that inter-layer magnetic interactions drive the lattice phase transition to the low-temperature structures. The accompanying bilayer hybridization through inter-layer dimerization yields magnetic singlet-like ground states in the Cl, Br, and I compounds. We further prove that all low-temperature compounds are dynamically stable and that electron-phonon coupling to the low-energy subspace is suppressed. Our findings establish Nb$_3$X$_8$ as a robust, versatile, and tunable class for van der Waals-based Coulomb and Mott engineering with a rich phase diagram and allow us to speculate on the symmetry-breaking effects necessary for the recently observed Josephson diode effect in NbSe$_2$/Nb$_3$Br$_8$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a strongly enhanced entanglement within the pseudogap regime of the Hubbard model. This entanglement is estimated from the quantum Fisher information and, avoiding the ill-conditioned analytical continuation, the quantum variance. Both are lower bounds for the actual entanglement that can be calculated from the (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, obtained here with the dynamical vertex approximation. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental neutron scattering experiments for various cuprates. Theory predicts a $\ln(1/T)$ divergence of the entanglement for low temperatures $T$, which is however cut-off by the onset of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Impact of Broken Inversion Symmetry on Molecular States in multi-Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking in impurity dimers coupled to topological multi-Weyl systems in the low-energy dispersion domain. In the IS-preserved multi-Weyl semimetal phase, Hubbard bands split into symmetric and antisymmetric molecular-like subbands. Breaking IS induces a transition to a multi-Weyl metal, lifting the degeneracy of the Weyl node and closing the pseudogap. This causes opposite energy shifts: valence-band symmetric (antisymmetric) subbands red- (blue-) shift, reversing in the conduction band until a degeneracy point. Beyond this threshold, symmetric bands flatten near band cutoffs, whereas antisymmetric bands form quasi-zero energy modes asymptotically approaching -- yet never crossing -- the Fermi level. Crucially, identical molecular symmetries maintain nondegeneracy even as energy separation vanishes with stronger IS breaking. Our results demonstrate symmetry-selective mechanisms for topological molecular states in multi-Weyl systems.</description>

      <title>Adjudicating Conduction Mechanisms in High Performance Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.</description>

      <title>Instability of Nagaoka State and Quantum Phase Transition via Kinetic Frustration Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Nagaoka-Thouless (NT) ferromagnetic instability in the strongly interacting $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model by continuously breaking particle-hole symmetry on a tunable square-triangular lattice geometry. We use an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$ exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit. Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density, making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\'e Hubbard platforms under strong interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit a spin-split band structure despite having zero net magnetization, leading to special magnonic properties such as anisotropic magnon lifetimes and field-free spin transport. Here, we present a direct experimental demonstration of non-local magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}, using both spin Seebeck and spin Hall effect-based injection and detection. We observe a non-local spin signal at zero magnetic field when the transport is along an altermagnetic direction, but not for transport along other directions. The observed sign reversal between two distinct altermagnetic directions in the spin Seebeck response demonstrates the altermagnetic nature of the magnon transport. In contrast, when transport is aligned along or perpendicular to the easy axis, both the first-harmonic signal and the sign-reversal effect vanish, consistent with symmetry-imposed suppression. These findings are supported by atomistic spin dynamics simulations, as well as linear spin wave theory calculations, which explain how our altermagnetic system hosts anisotropic spin Seebeck transport. Our results provide direct evidence of direction-dependent magnon splitting in altermagnets and highlight their potential for field-free magnonic spin transport, offering a promising pathway for low-power spintronic applications.</description>
