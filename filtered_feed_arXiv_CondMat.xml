      <title>The generic Mott transition in the sine-Gordon model through an embedded worm algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generic Mott transition in one-dimensional quantum systems can be described by the sine-Gordon model with a tilt via bosonization. Because the configuration space of the sine-Gordon model separates into distinct topological sectors, standard local Monte Carlo schemes are limited to very small system sizes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the smooth worm (SmoWo) Monte Carlo algorithm which enlarges the configuration space to allow smooth transitions between topological sectors. The method combines worm updates with event-chain Monte Carlo moves. We explicitly prove its validity and quantify its performance. Thanks to the substantial acceleration achieved by the SmoWo algorithm, we are able to simulate large system sizes, providing a precise picture of the different phases and critical behaviour of the sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Charge-Doping via Photo-Thermionic Injection in van der Waals Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials have become a rich playground for the exploration of correlated quantum phases, and recent studies have begun to probe their non-equilibrium dynamics under femtosecond laser excitation. In a time-resolved experiment, optical excitation of the multilayer structure can lead not only to rich dynamic responses from the target layers, such as moir\'e interfaces, but also to additional device functionality from the layer degree of freedom. Here, we investigate optical excitation in a prototypical moir\'e device of dual-gated twisted WSe2 bilayers, with few-layer graphite gates and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacers. We establish an ultrafast photodoping mechanism in the moir\'e bilayer from photo-thermionic emission of the graphite gates. Using transient reflectance experiments, we reveal photo-induced hole injection evidenced by: (i) a shift of gate voltages at which optical signatures of correlated insulators are observed, (ii) a persistent optical signature indicative of charge diffusion at microsecond timescales and local charge buildup from pulse-to-pulse accumulation, and (iii) photoinduced absorption due likely to transient formation of correlated insulators. We further demonstrate that the injected holes can be selectively controlled by tuning the excitation energy, fluence, and gate bias.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional moir\'e engineering in zigzag graphene nanoribbons on hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e system composed of a zigzag graphene nanoribbon (GNR) placed on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Using an effective grid model derived from continuum elasticity theory, we calculate the relaxed atomic structure of the GNR/hBN system for various twist angles and ribbon widths. The relaxation gives rise to a characteristic 1D domain structure consisting of alternating commensurate AB$'$ regions and two distinct types of domain boundaries. At finite twist angles, the ribbon adopts a wavy shape, locally tracing the hBN zigzag direction but occasionally sliding to adjacent atomic rows. The resulting moir\'e potential strongly modulates the electronic structure: the zero-energy zigzag edge states are modulated by the local stacking, leading to densely packed subbands in the AB$'$ domains and sharply localized domain-wall states in the energy gaps between domain plateaus, which together realize gate-tunable one-dimensional arrays of quantum-confined electronic states. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e modulation in GNR/hBN heterostructures provides a versatile platform for electronic structure engineering and the design of 1D moir\'e nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Versatile tunable optical injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions in a magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise probe and control of various quantum degrees of freedom in novel quantum matter are central to understanding fundamental quantum physics and hold promise for innovative routes to encode and process information. Chirality is one such degree of freedom that has recently attracted intense research interest, especially for Weyl fermions in topological Weyl semimetals. The coupling of chiral degrees of freedom through light-matter interactions and the versatile control of these couplings through external fields can lead to precise quantum control of Weyl fermions. In this work, we demonstrate the observation of light chirality-dependent photocurrent in the mid-infrared regime. Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the photocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by chiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates unbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order nonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such coupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the magnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the chirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable circular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but also pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral quantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Optimal spin-charge interconversion in graphene through spin-pseudospin entanglement control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in an interacting model of Kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice is a widely used interacting model for describing the electronic properties of various transition metal-based Kagome materials. We find altermagnetism driven by Coulomb interaction in the Kagome Hubbard model at Dirac filling with no spin-orbit coupling nor explicit spatial symmetry breaking present. We show how this insulating altermagnet is relevant to other lattices with larger unit cells such as the Lieb-Kagome lattice. The ALM found displays a characteristic magnon splitting which can be detected in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on interacting Kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers host maze-like stripe domains that transform into a disordered bubble/skyrmion lattice under out-of-plane magnetic fields at ambient temperature. Femtosecond magneto-optics distinguishes these textures via their distinct coherent breathing dynamics. Crucially, applying a brief in-plane ``set'' magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations reveal that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Thus, modifying the initial domain configuration by in-plane fields enables precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond timescales and potentially even of topology.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced structural change and nearly-commensurate diffuse scattering in the model high-temperature superconductor HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the strain response of underdoped HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Hg1201), by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and corresponding simulations of thermal diffuse scattering. The compression in the crystallographic $a$ direction leads to relatively small expansion in the $b$ and $c$ directions, with Poisson ratios $\nu_{ba}$=0.16 and $\nu_{ca}$=0.11, respectively. However, the Cu-O distance in the $c$ direction exhibits a notable 0.9% increase at 1.1% $a$-axis compression. We further find strain-induced diffuse scattering which corresponds to a new type of two-dimensional charge correlation. Interestingly, this signal is insensitive to the onset of superconductivity and instead corresponds to a short-range, nearly commensurate modulation with a wave vector close to (0.5, 0, 0) and a correlation length of approximately four unit cells. It closely resembles the charge order theoretically predicted in the phase diagram of the spin-liquid model with resonating valence bonds on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Optimal superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity has pointed to twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer as a versatile platform for studying the correlated and topological phases of matter. Here we analyze the effect of the displacement field and electron interactions on the formation of a topological paired state in twisted WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on the effective single band $t$-$J$-$U$ model supplemented with intersite Coulomb interaction term and treated within the Gutzwiller approximation. We show that the superconducting phase is stabilized in a small range of displacement fields where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling, which is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data. According to our analysis, such a circumstance comes as a result of a subtle interplay between the large density of states of the Van Hove singularity, in combination with the renormalization effects that appear in the weak-to-moderate correlations regime. The two factors create favorable conditions for the SC pairing only in a small area of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Examining the Spin Structure of Altermagnetic Candidate MnTe Grown with Near Ideal Stoichiometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently-discovered class of materials with magnetic ordering that have a zero net magnetization and a momentum-dependent spin splitting in their band structure, arising from a collinear spin arrangement with alternating polarizations in the crystal lattice. The nickeline-structured manganese telluride ({\alpha}-MnTe) is an attractive altermagnet candidate due to its predicted large spin splitting energy and a transition temperature near 300K. In this work, we present a thorough investigation of the spin structure of {\alpha}-MnTe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy with very high crystal quality and low residual magnetization. The epitaxial {\alpha}-MnTe films have a full-width-at-half-maximum of 0.1{\deg} as measured by x-ray-diffraction rocking curves and a root-mean-square roughness below 1 nm. Neutron diffraction measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic order in the {\alpha}-MnTe film and show a N\'eel temperature of 307 K. Polarized neutron reflectometry detects a vanishingly small net magnetization which may be confined to the MnTe/InP interface, highlighting the near-ideal stoichiometry in the sample. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that the bulk band spectrum of the MnTe films is consistent with the weak altermagnetic order as theoretically predicted and observed for the high symmetry nodal plane in the center of the Brillouin zone. This study establishes optimized growth conditions for the synthesis of stoichiometric {\alpha}-MnTe thin films which exhibit exceptional structural and magnetic ordering, thereby providing a robust platform for the precise characterization of their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Exciton-based sensing of remote electron correlations in 2D heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, are direct bandgap two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with sharp optical resonances at excitonic bound state frequencies. Recent experiments have demonstrated that excitonic resonance frequencies in multilayer van der Waals stacks are altered by long-range Coulomb interactions with electrons in nearby but electrically isolated 2D materials. These modulations have been successfully used to detect transitions between distinct states of remote strongly correlated 2D electron fluids. In this Letter we provide a theory of these frequency shifts, enabling a more quantitative interpretation of excitonic-sensing experiments, and apply it as an example to WSe$_2$ that is proximate to graphene bilayers and multilayers.</description>

      <title>ARPES of Bi2212 interpreted via a particle in a system of dynamic scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I employ parabolic cylinder functions to quantitatively describe the ARPES spectra of an over-doped Bi2212 across the temperature range 6 - 140K at the antinode k-point. These functions come from the solutions of a particle moving in a system of random scatterers. The parameters, i.e. the overall amplitude (A), the spectral coherence scale (C), and the energy shift (EG), are determined directly by fitting to experimental data. At 140K, the dominated feature of the ARPES spectrum resembles the solution of a particle moving in a one-dimensional random system. According to the present model, the electronic states of the over-doped Bi2212 at the antinode k-point can be viewed as a realization of the theory of a particle moving in dynamic scatterers in 1D with corrections from the ground state solutions at lower temperature.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition in One-Dimensional Bose-Hubbard Model in the Strong Interacting Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigated the dynamical quantum phase transitions in the Bose-Hubbard model using the Loschmidt echo as an observable, revealing that after a quench, the global Loschmidt echo exhibits cusp singularities with a logarithmically divergent rate function near criticality and a critical exponent of zero. Through extensive calculations across various system sizes and initial states, we have demonstrated that in the strongly interacting regime, the critical singularity of dynamical quantum phase transitions exhibits consistency across different model details and initial product states (charge-density wave states). Moreover, we find that modifying the harmonic potential well not only preserves the phase transition but also enables precise control over the transition timing.</description>

Abstract: Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal "More is Different" paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Planar Hall effect in nanostructures of trigonal-PtBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.</description>

      <title>Flat band driven itinerant magnetism in the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands can induce strong electron correlation effects that help stabilize both magnetic and superconducting states. Here, we carry out angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structure of the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$. We find that, while the $k_z$ Fermi topology of ferromagnetic LaCo$_2$P$_2$ is markedly 2-dimensional, antiferromagnetic CaCo$_2$As$_2$ develops a 3D Fermi surface described by a $zig-zag$-like band dispersion perpendicular to the Co-As plane. Furthermore, the magnetism is driven by the electronic correlations of the flat bands with $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbital character at the Fermi level. Our results link the electronic dimensionality and the magnetic order, and emphasize the critical role of the As-As and P-P bond strength along the $c$-direction to understand the electronic band structure and the rich phase diagram of transition metal pnictides.</description>

      <title>Cooper pair condensation from entanglement-entropy collapse of many-body states in sheared bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moir\'e supercell. In this regime, we show by means of a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation that the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. We adopt an exact diagonalization approach, on top of the Hartree-Fock approximation, to show how the condensation of Cooper pairs takes place in the strong-coupling limit of a valley-polarized flat band. A key factor of our proposal is the existence of zero entanglement-entropy many-body states, just made of a single Slater determinant, which are immune to the hybridization with the rest of the states under the strong Coulomb interaction. Moreover, we show that single-particle states with reverse sign of valley symmetry breaking have complementary charge distributions in the supercell, leading to a ground state where the Coulomb repulsion is minimized by placing electrons with opposite spin in different valleys. We argue that the collapse of the entanglement entropy causes the formation of many-body ground states with Cooper pairs made of electrons and their respective partners under valley symmetry, unveiling a strong-coupling mechanism of condensation in a flat band with initially no Fermi line.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Transport Signatures of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in a Weyl Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions in solids are often accompanied by structural changes, but subtle lattice distortions can remain hidden from conventional crystallographic probes, hindering the identification of the correct order parameters. A case in point is Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated polar ruthenate with well-characterized phase transitions, whose ground state structure has recently become a subject of debate. This uncertainty stems from extremely small atomic displacements ($\sim$0.001 \AA) between competing phases, beyond the resolution of X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or optical second-harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a method to detect hidden symmetry breaking by leveraging nonlinear transport induced by quantum geometry. We show that Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a Weyl chain semimetal in both phases. The low-symmetry phase, classified as an altermagnet by symmetry, features distorted topological surface states that are asymmetric along the polar ($b$) axis. However, the nonrelativistic spin splitting is too weak ($\sim$0.1 meV) to be resolved directly, regarding the altermagnetism. In contrast, Weyl chains generate a large quantum metric at the Fermi surface, leading to nonlinear conductivities that are orders of magnitude stronger in the low-symmetry phase. A longitudinal nonlinear conductivity along the polar axis emerges exclusively in this phase, providing a sensitive probe to qualitatively distinguish it from the high-symmetry structure and demonstrate the emergence of altermangetism, which is confirmed by a recent experiment. Our work establishes a route for identifying hidden symmetry breaking in complex quantum materials through the interplay of crystal symmetry, topology and nonlinear quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Multimode NOON-state generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Dopant site occupancy determined by core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the elastic scattering regime, probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns have proven robust for estimating specimen thickness and mistilt. Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of graphene aerogels toward the absorption of liquid and gas pollutants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental disasters, such as the oil spill in Mexico gulf or, more recently, the Mauritius oil spill caused by a bulk carrier vessel, are some of the ecological issues that the modern society faces frequently. These accidents highlight the need for development of efficient materials that can be employed to eliminate pollutants including crude oil and its derivatives, as well as toxic organic solvents. The objective of the present study is to achieve the synthesis of graphene aerogels with two main methods and to determine their efficiency as absorbents of liquid and gas pollutants. Graphene aerogels were prepared according to the information given by Hong et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2015). Both methods are based on the chemical reduction of graphene oxide as the first step and the formation of the aerogel as the second, providing a more cost-effective solution and resulting in a lattice structure similar to graphene. The fabricated materials were investigated for their absorption capacity for liquid and gas pollutants. The specimens were mounted in airtight microenvironments saturated with a specific Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Three VOCs were tested; formaldehyde, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the results were based on gravimetric measurements. In order to increase the accuracy of the obtained data, a VOCs sensor was used to measure the change of voltage before and after the introduction of graphene aerogels in a saturated microenvironment. Furthermore, the graphene aerogels were evaluated as absorbents in organic solvents, namely acetone, ethanol and methanol.</description>
