      <title>Hunting for superconductivity in doped triangular lattice Kitaev magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by exploring correlated metals with frustrating bond-dependent exchange interactions, we study hole and electron doped Kitaev Mott insulators on the triangular lattice. Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K&gt;0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K&lt;0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping, beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K&lt;0$ model, the doped $K&gt;0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K &gt; 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\rm sc} &lt; 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Unnecessary quantum criticality in $SU(3)$ kagome magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic/Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of critical quantum ground states that do not have a quasi-particle description. DSLs and related spin liquid phases often arise in strongly frustrated quantum spin systems, in which strong correlations and quantum fluctuations among constituent spins persist down to zero temperature. In this work, we analyze Mott insulating phases of $SU(3)$ fermions on a kagome lattice which may realize a DSL phase, described at low energies by $(2 + 1)d$ quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=6$ Dirac fermions. By analyzing the action of physical symmetries on the operators of the QED$_3$ theory, we conclude that the low energy DSL is a quantum critical point that can be accessed by tuning a single microscopic parameter. Aided by the emergent symmetry and anomalies of the low energy effective theory, we conjecture and present supporting arguments that the $SU(3)$ Kagome magnet DSL is an unnecessary quantum critical point, lying completely within a single phase.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlation effects in the response of graphene and MoS2 monolayers to the impact of highly-charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of highly-charged ions with monolayers of graphene and MoS2 is theoretically investigated based on nonequilibrium Green Functions (NEGF). In a recent paper [Niggas et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 086802 (2022)] dramatic differences in the response of the two materials to an impacting slow ion were reported. Here, this analysis is extended, focusing on the effect of electron-electron correlations in the monolayer on the electronic response to the ion. We apply the recently developed time-linear G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020)] combined with an embedding approach [Balzer et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 155141 (2023)]. We demonstrate that, while electronic correlations have a minor effect in graphene, they significantly influence the electron dynamics in the case of MoS2. Our key results are the ultrafast dynamics of the charge density and induced electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the impact point of the ion.</description>

      <title>Identifying the magnetic genes in fully- and partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al ($X$ = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicomponent Heusler alloys exhibit various magnetic properties arising from their diverse atomic compositions and crystal structures. Identifying the general physical principles that govern these behaviors is essential for advancing their potential in spintronic applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory with atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic ground states, finite-temperature magnetic transitions, and electronic structures of fully-ordered $L2_1$-, $XA$-type, and partially-ordered V$_2X$Al ($X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys. We introduce the concept of magnetic genes, defined as V-$X$-V triangular motifs connected by the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$. Within this framework, the magnetic ground states and transition temperatures across the V$_2X$Al family can be consistently understood. The magnetic order is primarily governed by the NN $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$ interactions in the triangular genes, while the transition temperatures are additionally influenced by $J_{X-X}$ couplings. Furthermore, the magnetic genes are still proven to be effective in our calculations on partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al alloys from $L2_1$ to $XA$-type structures. Our results suggest that the concept of magnetic genes provides a unifying principle for understanding magnetic ordering in V-based Heusler alloys and could serve as a powerful guide for exploring magnetism and designing advanced spintronic materials in a broader class of Heusler systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon anharmonicity-driven charge density wave transition and ultrafast dynamics in 1T-TaS2/TaSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW), a symmetry-breaking collective phenomenon in condensed matter systems, exhibits periodic modulations of electron density coupled with lattice distortions, where the lattice plays a critical role via electron-phonon coupling. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) 1T-TaS2/TaSe2, experiments reveal rich temperature- and pressure-dependent CDW phase behaviors, along with metastable CDW states induced by ultrafast optical excitation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms governing thermal/pressure-driven transitions and particularly the microscopic evolution of CDW phases remain incompletely understood. Here, we perform first-principles anharmonic phonon calculations and machine-learning force-field molecular dynamics at finite temperatures/pressures to investigate the CDW transitions in 1T-TaS2/TaSe2. The calculated CDW transition temperature TCDW and critical pressure Pc are in quantitative agreement with experimental values. Our results demonstrate that the melting of CDW originates from phonon anharmonicity, with ionic fluctuations dominating the transition dynamics. We observe the microscopic evolution of CDW under varying temperature/pressure, revealing an ultrafast nucleation process of CDW (~3 ps). Our results emphasize the essential role of phonon anharmonicity in elucidating CDW transition mechanisms underlying, and advance fundamental understanding of CDW-related phenomena in TMDs.</description>

      <title>A Single-Molecule Quantum Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-exchange heat engines operate without moving parts or time-dependent driving, relying solely on static energy-selective transport. Here, we realize a particle-exchange quantum heat engine based on a single diradical molecule, only a few nanometers in size. We experimentally investigate its operation at low temperatures and demonstrate that both the power output and efficiency are significantly enhanced by Kondo correlations, reaching up to 53 % of the Curzon-Ahlborn limit. These results establish molecular-scale particle-exchange engines as promising candidates for low-temperature applications where extreme miniaturization and energy efficiency are paramount.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole Symmetric Slave Boson Method for the Mixed Valence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an analytic slave boson method for treating the finite $U$ Anderson impurity model. Our approach introduces two bosons to track both $Q\rightleftharpoons Q\pm1$ valence fluctuations and reduces to a single symmetric $s$-boson in the effective action, encoding all the high energy atomic physics information in the boson's kinematics, while the low energy part of the action remains unchanged across finite $U$, infinite $U$, and Kondo limits. We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for the single impurity Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Resonant transport and line-type resonances in tilted Dirac cone double-barrier structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of Dirac fermions in a graphene-based double-barrier structure composed of two tilted-cone regions separated by a central pristine graphene region. Using the transfer matrix method, we systematically analyze how different cone tilts affect Dirac fermion transmission. In reciprocal space, at fixed energy, the Dirac cones of distinct regions generate isoenergetic conical surfaces (Fermi surfaces). When these surfaces overlap, their intersections define ``active surfaces'' that enable fermion transmission. In the symmetric double-barrier configuration, coupling between the barriers and the central well gives rise to multiple resonance peaks, including line-type resonances, even within nominally forbidden energy zones. The number and positions of these resonances depend sensitively on the system parameters. These findings provide new insights into the role of Dirac cone tilt in complex junctions and may guide the design of nanoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional tilted-cone materials such as $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ and borophene.</description>

      <title>Spectral Functions of an Extended Antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg Model on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extended spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice, which includes both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, as well as a scalar chiral term. This model exhibits a rich phase diagram featuring several competing phases: different quantum spin liquids and various magnetically ordered states, including coplanar $120^\circ$ order, stripe order, and non-coplanar tetrahedral order. We employ large-scale matrix product state simulations optimized for GPUs to obtain high-resolution dynamical responses. Our calculations reveal the spectral features across both ordered and liquid regimes of the phase diagram, which we analyze in comparison with analytical predictions and field-theoretical approaches. We identify unique signatures of the ordered phases in the form of gapless Goldstone modes at the ordering wave vectors. Our results in the $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin-liquid regime are indicative of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. In the chiral spin-liquid phase, we find signatures of spinons as the fractional excitations of the underlying theory, manifested as the onset of a two-spinon continuum that agrees with predictions from the Kalmeyer-Laughlin ansatz for the ground-state wave function, and collective modes that can be viewed as spinon bound states. We discuss finite-size effects, their consistency with the presumptions from field-theory, and review the dynamical structure factor with regard to experimentally relevant features such as the occurrence of highly dispersive signals and the global distribution of spectral weight.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multigap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the interplay between its multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately -13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Robust Mottness and tunable interlayer magnetism in Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials have attracted extensive attention due to their correlated properties. The breathing kagome material system Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) is regarded as a Mott insulator. However, studies on the influence of interlayer coupling on its magnetic and Mott properties are lacking. In this work, we investigated the effect of interlayer coupling on bilayer properties of each Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) compound via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, considering 24 stacking configurations per material. We found that each bilayer material is a Mott insulator. Due to the competition between interlayer Pauli repulsion and hopping, most interlayer magnetism is AFM, a small number of cases show AFM-FM degeneracy, and the magnetic ground state of 3 configurations is interlayer FM, i.e., tunable interlayer magnetism occurs. This robustness of Mott states coexisting with tunable interlayer magnetism provide novel and comprehensive analysis and insights for the research of breathing kagome Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Lattice Distortion in the Spin-Triplet Superconductor Cu$_{x}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doped topological insulator Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has attracted considerable attention as a new platform for studying novel properties of spin-triplet and topological superconductivity. In this work, we performed synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements on Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (0.24$\leq x\leq$ 0.46) to investigate the coupling between the superconducting order parameter and crystal lattice. In the crystals in which the vector order parameter (${\boldsymbol d}$ vector) is tilted from the crystal high-symmetry directions as evidenced by nematic diamagnetic susceptibility, we find a sizable lattice distortion ($\sim$100 ppm) associated with the onset of superconductivity. In contrast, in crystals with the ${\boldsymbol d}$ vector aligned along the high-symmetry directions, we find no appreciable change in lattice constant. Together with a pronounced vestigial behavior of the distortion, the results are clear evidence for an odd-parity $E_u$ order parameter that couples with trigonal lattice. Furthermore, in the crystal with $x$ = 0.46 where diamagnetic susceptibility is isotropic in the plane, no lattice distortion accompanying the superconducting transition is found, which is in line with a chiral superconducting state in the highly doped region. Our work shows that lattice distortion can be a powerful diagnosing quantity for nematic superconductivity with two-component order parameter.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Driven Topological Phases in Kagome Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials have garnered substantial attention owing to their diverse physical phenomena, yet canonical systems such as the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family exhibit poor $Z_{2}$-type topological properties, spurring an urgent quest for kagome platforms hosting ideal topological states. Recently, Zhou et al. proposed the kagome-type IAMX family, which exhibits distinctive ideal topological states; however, their analysis is primarily restricted to the spinless approximation. In this work, we model relativistic effects in the IAMX family, demonstrating that tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength drives topological phase transitions and induces novel topological states, resulting in a rich phase diagram. The configuration of topological surface states evolves continuously as the SOC strength is modulated, consistent with the evolution of the topological phase transition. This suggests a viable route toward designing multi-functional topological devices. First-principles calculations performed on three specific IAMX compounds confirm that SOC governs their topological phases, in complete accord with our model analysis.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of superconductivity and inhomogeneous states in metallic hydrogen and electron systems with attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle transferable continuum model and second flat Chern band in twisted MoTe2 and WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a twist-angle transferable continuum model for twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (tTMD) homobilayers, using tMoTe2 and tWSe2 as examples. All model parameters are extracted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations at a single twist angle (3.89{\deg}) and monolayer data. Our model captures both lattice relaxation effects and the long-range behavior of piezoelectric and ferroelectric potentials. Leveraging lattice relaxations obtained via machine learning force fields (MLFFs), the model can be efficiently transferred to other twist angles without requiring additional DFT calculations. It accurately reproduces the DFT band dispersions and quantum geometries across a wide range of twist angles. Furthermore, our model reveals that a second flat Chern band arises near 2{\deg} when the interlayer potential difference becomes comparable to the interlayer tunneling. This continuum model provides a clear understanding and starting point for engineering novel electronic phases in moir\'e TMDs through twist angles and lattice relaxations.</description>

      <title>X-ray magnetic circular dichroism originating from the $T_{z}$ term in collinear altermagnets under trigonal crystal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the microscopic origin and spectral features of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) in collinear antiferromagnets with trigonal crystal fields, using $\alpha$-MnTe as a prototypical example. Although such systems exhibit zero net magnetization, we demonstrate that XMCD can emerge from the anisotropic magnetic dipole operator $T_{z}$, arising from quadrupolar spin distributions. By constructing a complete multipole basis and analyzing the symmetry conditions under trigonal distortion, we identify specific spin and orbital configurations that enable a finite XMCD response. Further, we employ both one-electron and multi-electron models, including spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions, to calculate the XMCD spectra for various $d^n$ configurations. Our findings provide theoretical benchmarks for XMCD in altermagnets and highlight the key role of orbital symmetry and magnetic anisotropy in realizing observable dichroic effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the excitations captured by the dynamical response of XYZ triangular spin-1/2 ladders. We complement experimental inelastic neutron scattering results on the compound $\text{Cs}_\text{2}\text{CoBr}_\text{4}$ with numerically exact simulations based on time-dependent matrix product state methods. Our results show that bound states of spinon excitations can arise in XYZ beyond the requirement of strong Ising anisotropies. We analyze the role of the frustrated triangular couplings on the excitations giving rise to the spin dynamical structure factor and show how the features of the bound states manifest themselves in the different polarization channels.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional electronic domain correlations in 1T-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of nanoscale electronic domains underpins many emergent phenomena of quantum materials, including the competition between charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, or the storage of information in phase-change memory devices. Coupling to electronic domains provides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase transitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by unique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has been studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the bulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional evolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor simulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we identify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions, and a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon cooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the transport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an anomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon heating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory applications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer stacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the landscape of Mottness and its proximity to superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mott physics is at the root of a plethora of many-body quantum phenomena in quantum materials. Recently, the stacked or twisted structures of van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a unique platform for realizing exotic correlated states in the vicinity of the Mott transition. However, the definitive feature of Mottness and how it rules the low-energy electronic state remain elusive and experimentally inaccessible in many interesting regimes. Here, we quantitatively describe a filling-controlled Mott state and its interplay with superconductivity by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy in a vdW bulk heterostructure, 4Hb-TaS$_2$, that interleaves strongly correlated 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with superconducting 1H-Ta$_2$ layers. The fine tunability of electron doping induced by interlayer charge transfer allows us to continuously track the spectral function with unsurpassed energy resolution from a depleted narrow band (0.2 electrons per site) toward a Mott transition at half filling. The gradually emerging Mott-Hubbard bands, followed by the sharpening and vanishing of the central quasiparticle peak as predicted in the Brinkman-Rice scenario, unambiguously demonstrate the Mott physics at play. Importantly, the renormalization of the low-energy electrons acts destructively on the superconducting pairing potential, leaving behind nonsuperconducting, paramagnetic puddles at the nanoscale. Our results reveal a seminal system near the border of the Mott criterion that enables us to illustrate the predictive power of the Hubbard model, and set such heterostructures as promising ground for realizing new correlated states in the heavily doped Mott regime.</description>

      <title>Dispersion interaction of two graphene sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir method for determining the dispersive force by varying zero vacuum energy fluctuations is applied to two graphene sheets in the approximation of the Drude model for surface conductivity. As an alternative, the Van Kampen summation method is used. The force is determined for small and for large distances between the sheets. The results of both models are quite similar. Precisely, at large distances, the attractive force decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At short distances, the force is a finite attractive one. With a small chemical potential, the force can have a minimum at distances of the order of 0.3 nm, then increases, reaches a maximum at distances of the order of 200 nm, and at large distances decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At a chemical potential of significantly more than 1 eV, a minimum is not observed.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature anisotropic in-plane spin dynamics in graphene induced by PdSe$_2$ proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures offer a versatile platform for tailoring electrical, magnetic, optical, and spin transport properties of materials through proximity effects. Notably, hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides have been shown to induce valley-Zeeman spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene, resulting in significant spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations. However, in-plane lifetimes remain isotropic due to the inherent threefold symmetry of the heterostructure. Here, we demonstrate that pentagonal PdSe$_2$, characterised by unique in-plane anisotropy, induces an unprecedented gate-tunable SOC in graphene. Our measurements reveal a remarkable 10-fold modulation of the spin lifetime for spins oriented within the graphene plane at room temperature. Moreover, the directional dependence of the spin lifetimes, along the three spatial directions, suggests the existence of a persistent in-plane spin texture component that dominates the spin dynamics. These findings deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures and open avenues for designing and engineering novel topological phases in graphene-based heterostructures within the strong SOC regime.</description>

      <title>Highly anisotropic 1D materials supported in exfoliable 2D coordination polymers with optical anisotropy switching via twist-engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform to study and control the physical properties of low-dimensional materials. While strategies developed for two-dimensional (2D) crystals are not directly transferable to one-dimensional (1D) systems, we can benefit from them by creating layers formed by interconnected chains. Here, we develop a molecular strategy to illustrate this concept consisting of assembling 1D materials in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Crystals of [FeX(pzX)(bpy)] (X = Cl, F; pz = pyrazole; bpy = bipyridine) consist of iron chains along the b-axis, crosslinked via bpy ligands along the a-axis to form 2D layers, stacked along the c-axis via vdW forces. This structural anisotropy manifests itself in highly-anisotropic optical properties, as demonstrated by optical measurements in the visible and terahertz ranges, results which are supported by DFT calculations. Chemical substitution enables the tuning of the optical properties, as exemplified by the photoluminescence of the Cl-derivative, which is quenched for the F-derivative. Thin-layers are obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and their optical properties are further tuned through the fabrication of orthogonally-twisted vdW heterostructures, enabling to effectively switch-off the optical anisotropy. Our work highlights the chemical flexibility of vdW layered MOFs as a platform for designing and manipulating 1D architectures.</description>

      <title>Polarization- and time-resolved nonlinear multi-photon spectroscopy for confocal microscopy of semiconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a versatile confocal microscopy setup for optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and multi-photon spectroscopy that enables polarization-resolved studies of semiconductor bulk crystals and low-dimensional structures. The system offers full polarization control in both excitation and detection, spatial scanning with micrometer resolution, and spectrally tunable excitation over a broad energy range from 0.5 to 4.0 eV, using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Samples are mounted in a helium-flow cryostat, allowing temperature control from 4 to 300 K. Magnetic fields up to 0.625 T can be applied in the Voigt geometry via an electromagnet. The nonlinear optical signals are analyzed using a high-resolution spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 60 $\mu$eV. We demonstrate the potential of the setup by means of SHG polarization tomography measurements on a Cu$_2$O crystal as well as through a SHG spectral scan of a ZnSe crystal over a wide energy range from 1.4 to 3.1 eV. Polarization-resolved confocal SHG mapping of various twisted mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ structures is also presented. In addition, time-resolved two-color pump-probe experiments are shown for a Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ crystal, illustrating the potential of the system for investigating coherent exciton and phonon dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</description>

      <title>Anomalous narrow-band correlation in a natural superconducting heterostructure</title>

Abstract: A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time. However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The checkerboard lattice has been proposed to host topological flat bands as a result of destructive interference among its various electronic hopping terms. However, it has proven challenging to realize experimentally due to the difficulty of isolating this structure from any significant out-of-plane bonding while maintaining structural integrity. Here, single crystals of Zr2CuSb3, a potential candidate for the checkerboard lattice, were synthesized using the solution (self-flux) method, and their structure was confirmed via X-ray diffraction. Electrical transport measurements indicate metallic behavior with electron-dominated carriers. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals multiple electron pockets and significant kz broadening due to its large c-axis and low dispersion features in k z. Density functional theory calculations further disentangle the contributions from each high-symmetry plane, providing a comprehensive characterization of electronic behavior.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the degree of band flatness and the anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the parameters of lattice relaxation using optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth of the two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of (generalized) optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Lastly, we demonstrate that the vanishing of flat band velocity and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient conditions for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case. In contrast, the determinant condition can only be saturated in anisotropic systems.</description>

      <title>Broadband, Flexible, Skin-Compatible Carbon Dots/Graphene Photodetectors for Wearable Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of wearable photodetectors demands a unique combination of broadband optical sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, and skin-compatibility, with these requirements rarely met simultaneously by existing technologies. Here, we present photodetectors that combine all of these performances. This is achieved by integrating carbon dots, engineered for extended ultraviolet-to-near-infrared absorption, with single-layer graphene transferred onto a plastic substrate. Unlike traditional quantum dot systems, our carbon dots achieve a broad ultraviolet-to-near-infrared response without toxic heavy metals. Graphene provides an efficient channel for charge transport, while a biocompatible chitosan-glycerol electrolyte enables efficient, low-voltage carrier modulation, with peak performance at approximately 0.5 V gate bias. The resulting photodetectors exhibit a broadband photoresponse with responsivities of approximately 0.19 A/W at 406 nm, 0.32 A/W at 642 nm, and 0.18 A/W at 785 nm. They maintain consistent performance at a bending radius of 0.8 cm with negligible degradation after repeated cycles. Furthermore, skin-compatibility assessments using the SkinEthic model confirm the non-toxic nature and suitability of our devices for direct skin contact. The combination of broadband absorption (400-800 nm), flexibility, and skin-compatibility, along with low-voltage operation ($&lt;$ 1.5 V), positions our photodetectors as promising building blocks for next-generation wearable optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent dynamical Hubbard functional for correlated solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06113v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at 10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation</description>

      <title>Bridging Grain Mapping and Dark Field X-ray Microscopy for Multiscale Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving how defects emerge and interact within the hierarchical structure of polycrystalline materials remains a core challenge in materials science. Grain-mapping methods such as three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) provide essential mesoscale context but lack the resolution to image lattice defects. Conversely, high-resolution methods like Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) capture lattice distortions but not the surrounding microstructure. Here, we introduce a transferable framework that unifies these complementary approaches into a single, non-destructive workflow. Enabled by open-source software, the method translates grain orientation and position data into precise goniometer settings for DFXM imaging without dismounting or reorienting the sample. Applied to an iron polycrystal containing 1100 grains, DFXM motor positions were calculated for all grains within seconds, enabling on-the-fly targeting of specific grains. This allows reproducible zooming from the millimetre-scale aggregate to individual dislocations. We resolve three-dimensional misorientation fields across grain boundaries with 36 nm pixel size, directly capturing grain-grain interactions within their microstructural context. Finally, we show transferability from LabDCT to synchrotron and XFEL platforms, enabling new ways of studying defect interactions across scales.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary-limited thermal transport in suspended thin graphite across an unexplored thickness regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk graphite.These results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of electronic wavefunctions, encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. Whereas Berry curvature-mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology is an important determinant of the behavior of a great number of condensed-matter systems, but until recently has played a minor role in elasticity. We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon, and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply-twisted connected ribbons.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial damping of magnetization currents in perturbed spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since perturbations are omnipresent in physics, understanding their impact on the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a vitally important but notoriously difficult question. On the one hand, random-matrix and typicality arguments suggest a rather simple damping in the overwhelming majority of cases, e.g., exponential damping according to Fermi's Golden Rule. On the other hand, counterexamples are known to exist, and it remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions such counterexamples appear. In our work, we consider the spin-1/2 XXZ chain as a paradigmatic example of a quantum many-body system and study the dynamics of the magnetization current in the easy-axis regime. Using numerical simulations based on dynamical quantum typicality, we show that the standard autocorrelation function is damped in a nontrivial way and that only a modified version of this function is damped in a simple manner. Employing projection-operator techniques in addition, we demonstrate that both, the nontrivial and simple damping relation can be understood on perturbative grounds. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings for the particle current in the Hubbard chain.</description>

      <title>Lattice Quantum Geometry Controlling 118 K Multigap Superconductivity in Heavily Overdoped CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the thermal structure evolution in CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d (Cu1234), a superconductor which exhibits a high critical temperature (Tc 118 K), high critical current density and large upper critical magnetic field. The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pseudogap behavior in a metal near an antiferromagnetic instability and apply the results to electron-doped cuprates. We associate pseudogap behavior with thermal magnetic fluctuations and compute the fermionic self-energy along the Fermi surface beyond Eliashberg approximation. We analyze the spectral function as a function of frequency (energy distribution curves, EDC) and momentum (momentum distribution curves, MDC). We show that the EDC display pseudogap behavior with peaks at a finite frequency at all momenta. On the other hand, MDC peaks disperse within the pseudogap, ending at a gossamer Fermi surface. We analyze magnetically-mediated superconductivity and show that thermal fluctuations almost cancel out in the gap equation, even when the self-energy is obtained beyond the Eliashberg approximation. We favorably compare our results with recent ARPES study [K-J Xu et al, Nat. Phys. 19, 1834-1840 (2023)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</description>
