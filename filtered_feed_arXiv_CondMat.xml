      <title>Pseudogap-induced change in the nature of the Lifshitz transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the density of states and the $B_{1g}$ nematic susceptibility extracted from Raman response data across the doping-driven Lifshitz transition comparing the weak and strong interaction cases. Our results were obtained using cluster dynamical mean field theory for the two-dimensional Hubbard model. In the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime, both quantities are approximately symmetric around the Lifshitz transition doping $p_{LT}$. In the strongly correlated regime, the low-doping pseudogap leads to an asymmetric, discontinuous evolution when the Fermi surface changes from hole-like to electron-like at $p_{LT}$. The Lifshitz transition thus changes character because it is tied to the pseudogap-Fermi-liquid transition. These results are consistent with available observations and should foster further experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of putative quantum criticality on YbV6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a recently discovered heavy-fermion compound that orders at T$_N\approx 0.4$ K and exhibits a magnetic field-tuned quantum critical point at $H \approx 10$ kOe. In this work, we have grown YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals by the self-flux method, to investigate their physical properties at ambient pressure and their electrical transport properties under hydrostatic pressure. At higher temperatures, we observed a decrease in the Kondo temperature, accompanied by the appearance of a local minimum followed by a local maximum, associated with the onset of the coherent Kondo regime. Power law fitting at low temperatures indicated a recovery of the Fermi-liquid regime for pressures below 1 GPa. Above 1 GPa, a reentrance of non-Fermi-liquid behavior is suggested by a decrease in the exponent $n$, accompanied by a substantial increase in the parameter $A$, indicating the approach of a new quantum criticality tuned by hydrostatic pressure. The broad range of interactions present in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$, including RKKY, crystalline electric field (CEF), and Kondo lattice effects, appears to lead to a complex phase diagram. We present a putative phase diagram featuring double quantum criticality tuned by both magnetic field and hydrostatic pressure.</description>

      <title>Surface Topological Quantum Criticality II: Conformal manifolds, Isolated fixed points and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Fractal growth of higher-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding crystal growth and morphology is a fundamental issue in condensed matter physics. In this work, we reveal the fractal morphology of growing crystals of higher-order topological insulators and show that the corners of the crystals grow preferentially compared to the edges in the presence of the corner states. We further demonstrate that when we compare the crystal shape of the higher-order topological insulator with that of the trivial insulator with the same value of the fractal dimension $D_f$, the former has a smaller value of the fractal dimension of coastlines $D_{f,c}$ than the latter. This indicates that, for crystals with a similar degree of corner development, those in the higher-order topological phase have smoother edges. Because the relationship between the area and the perimeter of the crystals is governed by the ratio of these fractal dimensions, the higher-order topological insulator and the trivial insulator exhibit distinct perimeter-area relationships.</description>

      <title>Hard and soft phase slips in a Fabry-P\'erot quantum Hall interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometers are sensitive to the properties of bulk quasiparticles enclosed by the interferometer loop, with the interference phase containing information about both the quasiparticle statistics and the Coulomb-mediated bulk-edge coupling. Previous studies have explored the role of the bulk-edge coupling in an equilibrium picture where quasiparticles enter and exit the interferometer rapidly compared to the timescale over which the interferometer phase is measured. Here, we present data from a monolayer graphene quantum Hall interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime at $\nu = -1$ and $\nu = -2$. Quantum interference shows phase slips associated with the entrance of quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. Tracing the dependence of these phase slips on the magnetic field, we show that the equilibration time can become as long as several minutes. We further use our multi-gated geometry to identify two classes of phase slips. The first is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle to a bulk `puddle' of quasiparticles uniformly coupled to the entire chiral edge state, while the second is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle trapped by a defect site that couples predominantly to the closest portion of the edge.</description>

      <title>Evolution from Topological Dirac Metal to Flat-band-Induced Antiferromagnet in Layered KxNi4S2 (0&lt;=x&lt;=1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems with coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, and a switchable control between them within a single system, are desirable but remarkably uncommon. Here we report a layered quantum material system, KxNi4S2 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1), that simultaneously hosts both characteristics without involving typical Kagome/honeycomb lattices. Enabled by a topochemical K-deintercalation process, the Fermi surface can be fine-tuned continuously over a wide range of energies. Consequently, a non-magnetic Dirac-metal state with a topological nontrivial Z2 index of 1;(000), supported by first-principles calculations and high mobility up to 1471 cm2V-1s-1, is observed on the K-rich x = 1 side, whereas a flat-band induced antiferromagnetic state with TN up to 10.1 K emerges as K-content approaches 0. The KxNi4S2 system offers a versatile platform for exploring emerging phenomena and underscores a viable pathway for in-situ control of quantum materials dominated by Dirac cones, flat bands, and their interplay.</description>

      <title>TbPt6Al3: A rare-earth-based g-wave altermagnet with a honeycomb structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the Tb-honeycomb lattice compound TbPt6Al3, which crystallizes in the NdPt6Al3-type trigonal structure, have been studied by the measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetization M(T, B), and specific heat on single-crystalline samples. The magnetic susceptibility, M(T)/B, for B || c = 0.1 T shows a cusp at TN = 3.5 K, which temperature decreases with increasing the magnitude of B || c, while M(T)/B for B || a = 0.1 T remains constant with decreasing temperature below TN. This anisotropic behavior suggests a collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order of the Tb3+ moments pointing along the c axis. The data of M(T)/B for T &gt; 10 K on the single crystal and that of inelastic neutron scattering from powdered samples have been simultaneously analyzed using the crystal field model. The analysis reveals the non-Kramers doublet ground state for the Tb3+ ion under the trigonal crystal field. The neutron powder diffraction measurement shows that the collinear AFM structure with a magnetic propagation vector k = [0, 0, 0] is associated with moments of 5.1 {\mu}B/Tb pointing along the c axis. Comparison of the magnetic point group with the nontrivial spin Laue group indicates that TbPt6Al3 is classified into bulk g-wave altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Possible Spin Triplet Pairing due to Altermagnetic Spin Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between unconventional superconductivity and altermagnetic order has attracted much attentions. In particular, whether spin-triplet superconductivity can be achieved by suppressing altermagnetism remains an open issue. We investigate this issue using a minimal single-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice with vacancy superstructure, in which both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic order can emerge on equal footing. We illustrate the existence of a metallic normal phase with altermagnetism even at half-filling due to the geometric frustration and Coulomb interaction. Suppressing the altermagnetic long-range order using charge doping can lead to both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spin fluctuation. The spin-singlet pairing is always favored when the conventional antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation dominates. However, when the altermagnetic spin fluctuation dominates, spin-triplet pairing may be induced. Implications of our results in possible material candidates are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Elemental Frequency-Based Supervised Classification Approach for the Search of Novel Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The machine learning based approaches efficiently solves the goal of searching the best materials candidate for the targeted properties. The search for topological materials using traditional first-principles and symmetry-based methods often requires lots of computing power or is limited by the crystalline symmetries. In this study, we present frequency-based statistical descriptors for machine learning-driven topological material's classification that is independent of crystallographic symmetry of wave functions. This approach predicts the topological nature of a material based on its chemical formula. With a balanced dataset of 3910 materials, we have achieved classification accuracies of 82\% with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and 83\% with the Random Forest (RF) model, where both models have trained on common frequency based features. We have checked the performances of the models using $5-fold$ cross-validation approach. Further, we have validated the models on a dataset of unseen binary compounds and have efficiently identified 22 common materials using both the models. Next, we implemented the $first-principles$ approach to confirm the topological nature of these predicted materials and found the topological signatures of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the implications of frequency-based descriptors is a practical and less complex way to find novel topological materials with certain physical post-processing filters. This approach lays the groundwork for scalable, data-driven topological property screening of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement architecture of beyond-Landau quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm exhibit fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Here, we use entanglement microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and N\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions. Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.</description>

      <title>Radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals offer access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Here, we investigate the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The (103) surface is an example of a low symmetry surface that presents an apparent paradox to the bulk-boundary correspondence. The surface periodicity to which the topological surface states are expected to adhere does not correspond to the bulk periodicity of the Weyl points. By showing that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate replicas that accumulate into a superlattice commensurate with the surface Brillouin zone, we demonstrate how the apparent bulk boundary correspondence paradox is resolved and establish a universal criterion for arbitrary facets. The framework and experimental results further suggests that overlapping Fermi arcs can hybridize into closed Fermi arc loops, enriching boundary topology and enabling unconventional transport, interference, and collective phenomena unique to lowsymmetry facets.</description>

      <title>Pure dephasing increases partition noise in the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall edge channels partition electric charge over N chiral (uni-directional) modes. Intermode scattering leads to partition noise, observed in graphene p-n junctions. While inelastic scattering suppresses this noise by averaging out fluctuations, we show that pure (quasi-elastic) dephasing may enhance the partition noise. The noise power increases by up to 50% for two modes, with a general enhancement factor of 1+1/N in the strong-dephasing limit. This counterintuitive effect is explained in the framework of monitored quantum transport, arising from the self-averaging of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Disorder-driven Weyl-Kondo Semimetal Phase in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the observation of disorder-driven anisotropic Kondo screening and spontaneous Hall effect in bulk WTe${_2}$, a nonmagnetic type-II Weyl semimetal. We show that Kondo scattering emerges more prominently in disordered samples and produces magnetoresistance that is strongly anisotropic with respect to both current and magnetic field orientation, reflecting the underlying type-II Weyl dispersion. Strikingly, we find a spontaneous Hall effect in zero magnetic field, whose magnitude is enhanced with disorder, together with a large second-harmonic Hall signal exhibiting quadratic current scaling. Our analysis indicates that disorder-driven Kondo interactions pin the Fermi level near the Weyl nodes. This enhances the Berry curvature-driven nonequilibrium transport, accounting for both the second-order and spontaneous Hall responses. These findings establish disordered WTe${_2}$ as a platform hosting Weyl-Kondo fermions and highlight disorder as an effective control knob for inducing correlated topological phases in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains engineered from semiconducting quantum dots coupled by superconducting segments offer a promising route to realize and control Majorana bound states for topological quantum computation. We study a dimerized Kitaev chain--equivalent to a superconducting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model--and analyze the behavior of the resulting two coupled chains. We show that interference between Majorana edge modes from each chain gives rise to observable signatures in nonlocal conductance. Additionally, we identify a parity effect in the system length that governs the coupling of edge states, supported by an analytical model. Our results provide experimentally accessible probes for Majorana hybridization in mesoscopic topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based search of quantum phases: discovering unconventional fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and understanding of new quantum phases has time and again transformed both fundamental physics and technology, yet progress often relies on slow, intuition-based theoretical considerations or experimental serendipity. Here, we introduce a general gradient-based framework for targeted phase discovery. We define a differentiable function, dubbed "target-phase loss function", which encodes spectral fingerprints of a quantum state, thereby recasting phase search as a tractable optimization problem in Hamiltonian space. The method is broadly applicable to phases characterized by ground-state degeneracy and can be extended to a wide range of symmetry-broken and topological orders. As a demonstration, we apply it to spinless fermions on the kagome lattice and discover two distinctive fractional Chern insulators (FCIs), verified through detailed exact diagonalization: (i) at filling $\nu = 1/3$, a "non-ideal" Abelian FCI whose band geometry lies far beyond the Landau-level mimicry paradigm and all recent generalizations; and (ii) at $\nu = 1/2$, a non-Abelian FCI stabilized purely by finite-range two-body interactions. These results provide the first explicit realization of such types of FCIs and establish a versatile paradigm for systematic quantum-phase discovery.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws for Deep Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws--power-law relationships between generalization errors and characteristics of deep learning models--are vital tools for developing reliable models while managing limited resources. Although the success of large language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing data size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of high-quality Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) directly on dielectric substrates is crucial for electronic and optoelectronic applications, but there are still challenges such as poor quality, uncontrollable thickness and polycrystalline films. In this work, a novel method to grow high-quality and single-crystalline BLG directly on various dielectric substrates (SiO2/Si, sapphire, and quartz) was demonstrated. Single-crystalline monolayer graphene was applied as a seeding layer to facilitate the homo-epitaxial synthesis of single-crystalline BLG directly on insulating substrates. The Cu nano-powders (Cu NPs) with nanostructure and high surface-area were used as the remote catalysis to provide long-lasting catalytic activity during the graphene growth. The TEM results confirm the single-crystalline nature of the BLG domains, which validates the superiority of the homo-epitaxial growth technique. The as-grown BLG show comparable quality with the CVD-grown BLG on metal surface. Field-effect transistors directly fabricated on the as-grown BLG/SiO2/Si showed a room temperature carrier mobility as high as 2297cm2/Vs.</description>

      <title>Slow quasiparticle dynamics and anyonic statistics in a fractional quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyons are particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, their exchange statistics can be measured in the edge-state Fabry-P\'erot interferometer. In these devices, the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp}\theta_a$ to the interference signal. Here we report the observation of large, hysteretic phase jumps in a monolayer graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu=1/3$. When the filling factor is increased from $\nu&lt;1/3$ towards the center of the plateau, we observe phase slips with magnitude $\Delta \theta \approx 2\pi/3$, consistent with the addition of individual quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, the phase slips occur as instantaneous jumps in the interference signal, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes. We use this long timescale to investigate the effect of changes in interferometer area $A_I$ and $N_{QP}$ independently at fixed magnetic field, revealing a striking memory effect in the phase slip magnitude. In particular, as the $\nu=1/3$ plateau is approached from higher filling, we observed phase slips with $\Delta \theta$ significantly larger than $2\pi/3$ over the same range of gate voltage where quantized jumps are seen for increasing $\nu$. We discuss this asymmetry in terms of bulk-edge coupling of quasiparticles localized near the edge or in the bulk, and argue that this effect can be qualitatively reconciled with theoretical expectations for strongly interacting quasiparticles in the presence of weak disorder and strongly nonequilibrium charge dynamics. Our results highlight the key role played by charge dynamics on signatures of the anyon phase, and demonstrate that fractional quasiparticles can be indefinitely localized in nonequilibrium configurations.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Violation of Luttinger's theorem in one-dimensional interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we systematically investigate the evolution of the Luttinger integral in the one-dimensional generalized $t$-$V$ model as a function of filling and interaction strength, and identify three representative phases. In the weak-coupling regime, the zero-frequency Green's function exhibits a branch-cut structure at the Fermi momentum, and the Luttinger integral accurately reflects the particle density, indicating that the Luttinger theorem holds. As the interaction increases, the spectral weight near the Fermi momentum is gradually suppressed. Interestingly, in the strong coupling regime near half-filling, this singularity is progressively destroyed, accompanied by the emergence of momentum-space zeros in the real part of the Green's function, leading to a novel non-Fermi liquid metallic phase beyond the classic Luttinger liquid paradigm, where the Luttinger surface is no longer defined by a single singularity. While finite spectral weight remains at the original Fermi momentum, the singularity gradually diminishes. Meanwhile, zeros with negligible spectral weight appear away from this momentum, significantly affecting the integral. At exact half-filling, a single-particle gap opens, and the Green's function becomes nearly vanishing across the entire momentum space, indicating the complete suppression of low-energy electronic states consistent with the nature of an insulating charge-density-wave phase. These results suggest that the breakdown of the Luttinger theorem is not triggered by a single mechanism, but rather results from the interplay between interaction-driven evolution of excitation modes and the breaking of particle-hole symmetry, ultimately leading to a continuous reconstruction of the generalized Fermi surface from topologically protected to correlation-driven.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of novel moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer-atomic interactions. By introducing the density wave amplitude, we divide the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes at each stage. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is closely linked to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. The patterns exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting potential applications of this strongly frequency-dependent pattern formation in quantum precision measurement. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Wave-Packet Dynamics: Nonadiabatic Metric, Quantum Geometry, and Analogue Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for the nonadiabatic wave-packet dynamics of Bloch electrons subject to slowly varying spatial and temporal perturbations. Extending the conventional wave-packet ansatz to include interband contributions, we derive equations for the interband coefficients using the time-dependent variational principle, referred to as the wave-packet coefficient equation. Solving these equations and integrating out interband contributions yields the leading-order nonadiabatic corrections to the wave-packet Lagrangian. These corrections appear in three forms: (i) a nonadiabatic metric in real and momentum space, which we identify with the energy-gap-renormalized quantum metric, (ii) modified Berry connections associated with the motion of the wave-packet center, and (iii) an energy correction arising from spatial and temporal variations of the Hamiltonian. This metric reformulates the wave-packet dynamics as geodesic motion in phase space, enabling an analogue-gravity perspective in condensed matter systems. As an application, we analyze one-dimensional Dirac electron systems under a slowly varying exchange field $\bm{m}$. Our results demonstrate that variations in the magnitude of $\bm{m}$ are important to nonadiabatic dynamics, in sharp contrast to the adiabatic regime where directional variations of $\bm{m}$ are crucial.</description>

      <title>Neural Transformer Backflow for Solving Momentum-Resolved Ground States of Strongly Correlated Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor determines the i.i.d. conversion rate in the resource theory of asymmetry for any compact Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying physical concepts in terms of the ultimate performance of a given task has been central to theoretical progress, as illustrated by thermodynamic entropy and entanglement entropy, which respectively quantify irreversibility and quantum correlations. Symmetry breaking is equally universal, yet lacks such an operational quantification. While an operational characterization of symmetry breaking through asymptotic state-conversion efficiency is a central goal of the resource theory of asymmetry (RTA), such a characterization has so far been completed only for the $U(1)$ group among continuous symmetries. Here, we identify the complete measure of symmetry breaking for a general continuous symmetry described by any compact Lie group. Specifically, we show that the asymptotic conversion rate between many copies of pure states in RTA is determined by the quantum geometric tensor, thereby establishing it as the complete measure of symmetry breaking. As an immediate consequence of our conversion rate formula, we also resolve the Marvian-Spekkens conjecture on conditions for reversible conversion in RTA, which has remained unproven for over a decade. By applying our analysis to a standard setup in quantum thermodynamics, we show that asymptotic state conversion under thermal operations generally requires macroscopic coherence in the thermodynamic limit.</description>
