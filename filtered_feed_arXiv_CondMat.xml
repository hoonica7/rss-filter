      <title>Mott transition from the non-analyticity of the one-body reduced density-matrix functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-body reduced density-matrix functional (1RDMF) theory has yielded promising results for small systems such as molecules, but has not addressed quantum phase transitions such as the Mott transition. Here we explicitly execute the constrained search within a variational ansatz to construct a 1RDMF for the multi-orbital Hubbard model with up to seven orbitals in the thermodynamic limit. The variational ansatz is the \mathcal{N}=3 ansatz of the variational discrete action theory (VDAT), which can be exactly evaluated in d=\infty. The resulting 1RDMF exactly encapsulates the \mathcal{N}=3 VDAT results, which accurately captures Mott and Hund physics. We find that non-analytic behavior emerges in our 1RDMF at fixed integer filling, which gives rise to the Mott transition. We explain this behavior by separating the constrained search into multiple stages, illustrating how a nonzero Hund exchange drives the continuous Mott transition to become first-order. Our approach creates a new path forward for constructing an accurate 1RDMF for strongly correlated electron materials.</description>

      <title>The numerical case for identifying paired quantum Hall phases by their daughters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many candidate non-Abelian quantum Hall states are accompanied by nearby `daughter' states, which are proposed to identify their topological order. Combining exact diagonalization and trial wave functions, we provide numerical evidence that daughter states reliably predict the parent topological phase. In the contexts of bilayer graphene and wide GaAs quantum wells, we show that the same interactions simultaneously stabilize Pfaffian, anti-Pfaffian, and their daughters, while suppressing the Jain states. The competition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, which is decided by particle-hole symmetry-breaking interactions, can likewise be deduced from their daughters. These findings strongly support the daughter-state-based identification of non-Abelian quantum Hall phases.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moir\'e systems using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moir\'e materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an interlayer bias due to an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moir\'e bands. For small twist angles, the density of states as a function of filling and interlayer bias shows qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking. More interestingly, the Van Hove singularity becomes pinned to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. For aligned stacking this occurs only at zero electric field, while for antialigned stacking this happens both at zero and finite field. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1TtTMDs can be strongly tuned \textit{in situ} both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic moments in FeCr2S4 studied by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the element specific magnetic characteristics of single-crystal FeCr2S4 using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS spectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong hybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized rather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are antiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule. The orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017 {\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the d6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe site, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom in spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the gigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital degrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a finite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the tetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct indicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital magnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral crystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the quenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4.</description>

      <title>Influence of local strain on the optical probing of a Ni$^{2+}$ spin in a charged self-assembled quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the optical properties of quantum dots doped with a Ni$^{2+}$ ion that interacts with a charged exciton. Systematic magneto-optical analysis reveals that the strain distribution at the Ni$^{2+}$ site significantly influences its spin structure. In positively charged dots dominated by in-plane biaxial strain, the three spins states of the Ni$^{2+}$ (S$_z$=0, S$_z$=$\pm$1) can be observed and the magneto-optical spectra enables a local strain anisotropy to be determined. However, in most of the dots, lower-symmetry strain mixes all the Ni$^{2+}$ spin states, thereby increasing the number of observed optical transitions. In charged dots, we identify optical transitions that share a common excited state. They form a series of $\Lambda$ levels systems that can be individually addressed optically to determine the energy level structure. Magneto-optical measurements demonstrate that the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic and considerably stronger than the electron-Ni$^{2+}$ interaction. A spin-effective model that incorporates local strain orientation can successfully reproduce key experimental results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that low-symmetry terms in the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction must be considered in order to accurately describe the emission spectra details in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit a spin-split band structure despite having zero net magnetization, leading to special magnonic properties such as anisotropic magnon lifetimes and field-free spin transport. Here, we present a direct experimental demonstration of non-local magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}, using both spin Seebeck and spin Hall effect-based injection and detection. We observe a non-local spin signal at zero magnetic field when the transport is along an altermagnetic direction, but not for transport along other directions. The observed sign reversal between two distinct altermagnetic directions in the spin Seebeck response demonstrates the altermagnetic nature of the magnon transport. In contrast, when transport is aligned along or perpendicular to the easy axis, both the first-harmonic signal and the sign-reversal effect vanish, consistent with symmetry-imposed suppression. These findings are supported by atomistic spin dynamics simulations, as well as linear spin wave theory calculations, which explain how our altermagnetic system hosts anisotropic spin Seebeck transport. Our results provide direct evidence of direction-dependent magnon splitting in altermagnets and highlight their potential for field-free magnonic spin transport, offering a promising pathway for low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases in rhombohedral N-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy $k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA) and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number $N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas $SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave (PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may be constrained.</description>

      <title>Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Robust field re-entrant superconductivity in ferromagnetic infinite-layer rare-earth nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Linear Response from Zeeman Quantum Geometry in 2D Unconventional Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional magnets with zero net magnetization yet momentum-dependent spin splitting constitute a newly identified class of materials that provide a rich platform for quantum-geometry-driven transport phenomena. Exploiting the interplay between momentum translation and spin rotation, we uncover a distinct linear transport response governed by a generalized quantum geometric tensor, the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor (ZQGT). We show that the ZQGT drives a linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in the three prototypical two-dimensional unconventional magnets: a time-reversal-broken $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ altermagnet, a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, and a mixed $d$-wave altermagnet. Depending on symmetry, these magnets exhibit longitudinal, transverse, or combined conduction and displacement IGMCs in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Notably, this response persists even when conventional Berry curvature contributions vanish, offering a unique probe of hidden spin-split band structures of unconventional magnets. In particular, for mixed $d$-wave altermagnets, symmetric Berry curvature and antisymmetric quantum metric respectively generate longitudinal conduction IGMC and transverse displacement IGMC- responses absent in conventional quantum geometry. The predicted signatures, relevant to compounds such as RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe, provide experimentally accessible diagnostics for distinguishing unconventional magnetic phases. These findings position the ZQGT as a powerful framework for probing and controlling transport in next-generation quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Gauge flux generations of weakly magnetized Dirac spin liquid in a kagom\'{e} lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent progress on the Dirac spin liquid and the kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the U(1) Dirac spin liquid on the kagom\'{e} lattice and consider the response of this quantum state to the weak magnetic field by examining the matter-gauge coupling. Even though the system is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms. The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>New Upper Bounds on Exotic Neutron Spin-Electron Spin Interactions via Neutron Spin Rotation Measurements in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a search for exotic spin-spin interactions between neutrons and electrons which could signal new physics beyond the Standard Model using slow neutron polarimetric imaging through a dense medium of polarized electrons. Our dense polarized electron target is a ferrimagnet held at its magnetic compensation temperature, which realizes a polarized electron ensemble with zero net magnetization. We sought the spin rotation of transversely polarized neutrons from a neutron spin-electron spin interaction of the form $V_2=-g_A^eg_A^n\frac{\hbar c}{4\pi}\vec\sigma_e\cdot\vec\sigma_n\frac{e^{-r/\lambda_c}}{r}$, where $g_{A}^{e}$ and $g_{A}^{n}$ are the electron and neutron axial couplings, $\vec{\sigma_e}$ and $\vec{\sigma_n}$ are the electron and neutron spin, and $\lambda_c$ is the interaction range for an exotic axial vector interaction from massive spin-1 boson exchange of mass $\hbar c/\lambda_c$. The resulting average neutron spin rotation angle per unit length, $\frac{d\bar{\phi}_{F5}}{dz}=[0.41\pm6.30\ (stat.)\pm4.4\ (sys.)]\times10^{-3}$ rad/m, is consistent with zero. Our novel approach improves the previous upper limits on the coupling constant product $g_A^eg_A^n$ by several orders of magnitude in the poorly explored $10^{-8}\leq\lambda_c\leq10^{-2}$ range.</description>

Abstract: Probing the local structure and chemistry of wide-bandgap amorphous oxide thin films remains challenging due to the limitations of lab-based spectroscopy. This work integrates X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and classical electrostatic modeling of final-state core-ionization effects in Al atoms to uncover the structure and chemistry of amorphous alumina polymorphs made with atomic layer deposition (ALD). DFT calculations using the Delta Kohn-Sham method supported the interpretation of final-state effects and validated electrostatic model assumptions. Shifts in the measured Auger parameter were interpreted as extra-atomic relaxation energies, revealing sensitivity to the local coordination environment. Structural disorder and thermal fluctuations were found to govern the distribution of extra-atomic relaxation energies, suggesting that cryo-XPS can isolate and reveal intrinsic structural building blocks of amorphous oxides. Simulated heating and annealing demonstrated that Auger parameter shifts can serve as indicators of phase decomposition in H-supersaturated ALD amorphous alumina. These findings provide a pathway for comprehensive interpretation and predictive modeling of XPS spectra in amorphous wide-bandgap oxides.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Mixed-dimensional Behaviour in Infinite-layer Samarium Nickelate Thin Films</title>

Abstract: Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small $c$-axis parameter of 3.26 {\AA} and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. These results establish a clear correlation between decreasing $c$-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems. In addition, angle-dependent magnetoresistance investigations reveal the existence of a hybrid mixture of 2D and 3D superconductivity in this novel system with enhanced coupling between the rare-earth 5d and Ni 3d orbitals, confirmed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments. As the concentration of Eu increases, the system exhibits a clear tendency towards 3D superconductivity. Furthermore, we observe distinctive negative magnetoresistance in the europium-containing samples. These findings advocate clear materials design principles for higher transition temperatures and exotic physics in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and magnon Hall transport in an altermagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute magnon Hall conductivities in a minimal model of a two-dimensional altermagnet. To do so, we derive an analytic expression for the relevant quantum geometric tensor describing two-band bosonic Bogoliubov Hamiltonians, providing insight into the geometric, topological, and transport properties. The magnon thermal Hall and spin Nernst conductivities are shown to directly depend on the altermagnetic parameter, which may serve as an experimental probe of altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Coupling of magnetic and lattice collective excitations in the 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine polarized infrared magneto-transmission and Faraday angle rotation measurements to map the collective excitations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_3$. Below the N\'{e}el temperature ($T_\mathrm{N} \approx 118$ K), the phonon spectrum becomes strongly anisotropic, while a prominent excitation at 122 cm$^{-1}$ (15 meV) hardens on cooling and splits linearly with magnetic field,identifying its magnetic origin. From absolute transmission and Faraday angle measurements, we reconstruct the circular optical conductivities, revealing a pronounced dichroism of the field-split excitations. The upper branch near 129 cm$^{-1}$ shows an anomalously reduced dichroism, consistent with spin-phonon hybridization with a nearby infrared phonon. Several phonons exhibit sizable Faraday rotation, and Raman-active modes appear in the infrared spectra. Together with a broad mid-infrared band near 900 cm$^{-1}$ emerging only below $T_\mathrm{N}$, these observations point to inversion-symmetry breaking in the magnetic state. A weak Faraday feature near 320 cm$^{-1}$ ($\sim 40$ meV) further supports the presence of a higher-energy magnetic excitation. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$ and establish its relevance for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Geometric Floquet theory</title>

Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Statistics on Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistics of particles and extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information science, yet a comprehensive lattice-level framework for computing them remains elusive. In this work, we develop a universal microscopic method to determine the generalized statistics of Abelian excitations on lattices of arbitrary dimension, and demonstrate it by deriving the statistics of particles, loops, and membranes in up to three spatial dimensions. Our approach constructs a sequence of local unitary operators whose many-body Berry phase encodes the desired statistical invariant. The required sequence is generated automatically from the Smith normal form of locality constraints and therefore needs no extra physical input. We prove that the resulting invariants are quantized, provide an algorithm that computes them efficiently, and show how they unify familiar braiding and fusion data of particles while also uncovering new self- and mutual-statistics of loop and membrane excitations. We further demonstrate that each statistical invariant corresponds to an 't Hooft anomaly of a generalized symmetry; we show that a non-trivial invariant both (i) obstructs gauging that symmetry and (ii) forbids any short-range-entangled (symmetry-preserving) ground state. This establishes a precise connection between microscopic lattice anomalies and many-body dynamics, providing a generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem that constrains a wide class of quantum lattice systems.</description>
