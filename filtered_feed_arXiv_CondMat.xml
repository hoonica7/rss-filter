      <title>Dephasing-induced Quantum Hall Criticality in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that static disorder is indispensable to the integer quantum Hall effect, underpinning both quantized plateaus and the plateau-plateau transition. We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $\theta$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $\sigma$ model (NL$\sigma$M) for class A with a topological $\theta$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$. Evaluating $\theta$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $\sigma_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $\sigma_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps. By establishing dephasing as a self contained route to Hall criticality, our framework reframes plateau physics in open solid state and cold atom platforms and offers practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.</description>

      <title>Mechanical and electrical properties of a nano-gap or how to play the nano-accordion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has become an important technique to study dynamic processes at highest spatial resolution and one branch is the investigation of phenomena related with electrical currents. Here, we present experimental results obtained from a peculiar in-situ TEM device, which was prepared with the aim to analyze the relationship between (thermo)electric properties and specific crystal orientations of a misfit layered compound. The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents. The devices' electrical properties were found to be substantially influenced by the gap, leading to a high intrinsic voltage. This voltage additionally depends on the vacuum environment and on the history of applied heating currents. These findings are largely attributed to the presence of adsorbed molecules within the gap region. The electrical in-situ TEM studies of this work illustrate that interior surfaces can strongly influence electrical properties even under high vacuum conditions.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Composition and Band Gap in $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterostructures via STEM-EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution mapping of electronic properties at oxide heterointerfaces remains challenging due to probe delocalization and overlapping signals. In this work, we employ monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) to resolve band gap variations across $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based multilayers with nanometer-scale precision. A custom automated quantitative-based EELS analysis framework enabled automated band gap fitting and visualization, ensuring reproducibility and high spatial resolution. By optimizing acquisition parameters and quantifying inelastic delocalization, we demonstrate reliable extraction of band gap excitations from layers only a few nanometers thick. For heterostructures grown on ITO templates, strain at defect-free interfaces induces a gradual band gap transition from $5.08~\mathrm{eV}$ to $4.28~\mathrm{eV}$ over $\sim 10~\mathrm{nm}$, despite an abrupt compositional change. In contrast, ZnO-based templates introduce structural defects that relieve strain, yielding band gaps consistent with composition. These results establish STEM-EELS as a powerful tool for nanoscale electronic characterization and highlight the dominant role of interfacial strain over composition in governing local band structure.</description>

      <title>TEM Agent: enhancing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with modern AI tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have had a dramatic effect on capabilities and productivity across many disciplines involving critical thinking and writing. The development of the model context protocol (MCP) provides a way to extend the power of LLMs to a specific set of tasks or scientific equipment with help from curated tools and resources. Here, we describe a framework called TEM Agent designed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that leverages the benefits of LLMs through a MCP approach. We simultaneously access and control several subsystems of the TEM, a data management platform, and high performance computing resources through text-based instructions. We demonstrate the abilities of the TEM Agent to set up and complete intricate workflows using a simplified set of MCP tools and resources accompanying a commercial LLM without any additional training. The use of a framework such as the TEM Agent simplifies access to complex microscope ecosystems comprised of several vendor and custom systems enhancing the ability of users to accomplish microscopy experiments across a range of difficulty levels.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear magnetoresistance and paramagnetic singularity in Hypervalent Bismuthide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials featuring hypervalent bismuth motifs have generated immense interest due to their extraordinary electronic structure and exotic quantum transport. In this study, we synthesized high-quality single crystals of La3ScBi5 characterized by one-dimensional hypervalent bismuth chains and performed a systematic investigation of the magnetoresistive behavior and quantum oscillations. The metallic La3ScBi5 exhibits a low-temperature plateau of electrical resistivity and quasi-linear positive magnetoresistance, with anisotropic magnetoresistive behaviors suggesting the presence of anisotropic Fermi surfaces. This distinctive transport phenomenon is perfectly elucidated by first-principles calculations utilizing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Furthermore, the nonlinear Hall resistivity pointed towards a multiband electronic structure, characterized by the coexistence of electron and hole carriers, which is further supported by our first-principles calculations. Angle-dependent de Haas-van Alphen oscillations are crucial for further elucidating its Fermiology and topological characteristics. Intriguingly, magnetization measurements unveiled a notable paramagnetic singularity at low fields, which might suggest the nontrivial nature of the surface states. Our findings underscore the interplay between transport phenomena and the unique electronic structure of hypervalent bismuthide La3ScBi5, opening avenues for exploring novel electronic applications.</description>

      <title>AC magnetometry of van der Waals magnets using ultrasensitive Graphene Hall sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the dynamical magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials requires sensitive techniques capable of detecting small magnetic fields from nanoscale samples. We demonstrate quantitative AC and DC magnetometry of a ferromagnetic Fe3-xGeTe2 nanoflakes using ultrasensitive graphene Hall sensors. These devices achieve record-low magnetic field detection noise at both cryogenic and room temperature, enabled by hBN encapsulation, low-resistance fluorographene contacts, and a novel fabrication process. We perform quantitative AC susceptibility measurements up to 1 kHz, resolving both real and imaginary components with nanotesla-scale sensitivity and milliradian phase accuracy, the first such measurement in a van der Waals magnet. Our results establish graphene Hall sensors as a powerful and broadly applicable platform for studying magnetic and superconducting phases near the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topological superconductivity in type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetals with a hybrid pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed the self-consistent method on a two-orbital type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetal, revealing a hybrid pairing of singlet $s$-wave and triplet $p$-wave. We present a detailed analysis of the normal-state electronic structure and the self-consistent results. Our findings indicate that the selection of hybrid pairings is governed by distinct surface Fermi-arc configurations: specifically, $s$-wave pairing dominates on the bottom surface, while $p$-wave pairing prevails on the top. Furthermore, the emergent superconducting state is a second-order topological superconductors with hinge states in the system. Our results identify type-II time-reversal-invariant Weyl semimetals as a promising intrinsic platform for realizing unconventional and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>High-speed, High-Resolution, Three-Dimensional Imaging of Threading Dislocations in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Phase-Contrast Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a nondestructive, high-resolution method for three-dimensional imaging of threading dislocations in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ (010) using phase-contrast microscopy (PCM). A one-to-one correspondence between dislocation contrasts in PCM images and synchrotron X-ray topography (SR-XRT) images confirms the detection capability of PCM. Compared to SR-XRT, PCM provides enhanced spatial resolution, enabling the distinction of closely spaced dislocations with sub-10-micrometer separation. PCM facilitates direct visualization of dislocation propagation paths along the depth (z) direction by systematically shifting the focal plane into the crystal. In addition, the projection of stacked PCM images enables in-plane (XY) tracing of dislocation lines, providing insight into the preferred slip systems in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$. This work establishes PCM as a versatile and laboratory-accessible technique for three-dimensional, nondestructive characterization of dislocations across entire wide-bandgap semiconductor wafers within a practically acceptable time frame.</description>

      <title>Magnetization plateau and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the frustrated Kondo-lattice compound Ce3ScBi5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kondo metals with geometric frustration offer fertile ground for exploring exotic states of matter with a field-induced fractional magnetization platform and nonsaturating magnetoresistance. Herein, a Ce3ScBi5 single crystal with anti-Hf5Sn3Cu hexagonal structure was successfully synthesized via the bismuth self-flux method, leading to the formation of cerium cations arranged in a frustrated structure within a distorted kagome lattice. Magnetic measurements exhibit two distinct antiferromagnetic transitions at 4.1 and 5.9 K. Specifically, the occurrence of multiple metamagnetic transitions between magnetization plateaus is evidenced upon applying magnetic fields perpendicular to the c axis. Transport measurements highlight remarkable Kondo-lattice characteristics and anisotropic magnetoresistance in Ce3ScBi5. The anomalous Hall contributions are observed at low temperatures under critical fields, suggesting Fermi surface reconstruction in a subset of the metamagnetic transitions. We have constructed a temperature-field phase diagram to provide comprehensive information on the complex magnetic structures arising from competitive interactions. Our work establishes Ce3ScBi5 and related materials as a unique platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum fluctuations in bulk crystals, and analyzes the critical role of geometric frustration in Kondo and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida physical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Stability Frontiers and Mixed-dimensional physics in the Kagome Intermetallics Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional physics provides profound insights into strongly correlated interactions, leading to enhanced quantum effects and the emergence of exotic quantum states. The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transformations in metastable $\beta$ Zr15Nb alloy revealed by in-situ methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the phase transitions occurring during linear heating of the Zr15Nb alloy through a comprehensive, multi-technique methodology comprising in-situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), electrical resistance measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal expansion analysis, supplemented by ex-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The findings reveal a complex sequence of phase transformations and corresponding structural changes over a broad temperature range (from room temperature up to 800 ${\deg}$C). Two distinct body-centered cubic (bcc) $\beta$ phases - $\beta_{Zr}$ and $\beta_{Nb}$ - with closely related lattice parameters are identified. At room temperature, the microstructure is characterized by a mixture of the metastable $\beta_{Zr}$ + $\omega_{ath}$ phase. Upon heating, $\beta_{Zr}$ progressively decomposes, giving rise to the formation of $\beta_{Nb}$. TEM observation revealed the cuboidal shape of the $\omega_{iso}$ particles resulting from the high lattice misfit between $\beta$ and $\omega$ phase. The $\omega$ solvus temperature is determined to be approximately 555 ${\deg}$C, as evidenced by in situ HEXRD and abrupt changes in the alloy's thermal and electrical properties. The growth of the $\alpha$ phase occurs after the dissolution of the $\omega$ phase, resulting in a pronounced increase in thermal expansion.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Orbital Angular Momentum Induced by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electrons is dynamically induced by chiral phonons. The induced OAM originates from the adiabatic evolution in which electrons dynamically acquire Berry phase. By introducing a tight-binding model with p orbitals on a honeycomb lattice, we show a microscopic picture that chiral phonons modulate orbital overlaps of electrons, and calculate the generated OAM, whose sign depends on phonon chirality. We then construct an effective model for valley phonons with different phonon pseudoangular momenta (PAM) and identity their distinct intervalley-scattering channels. Our model obeys the selection rule between phonons and electrons with the orbital degree of freedom. Extending this framework to d-orbital electrons, our model is applied to describe the induced OAM in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results reveal a direct lattice-OAM transfer mechanism that emerges even in materials with weak spin-orbital coupling, opening a new promising way for orbitronics applications.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the recent study of Toeplitz braiding by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Heat Capacity and Phonon Dynamics in Expanded Graphite and EG--MWCNTs Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific heat of expanded graphite (EG) and EG--multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites (1.0 and 3.0 wt.\% MWCNTs) was measured between 2 and 300~K. The low-temperature heat capacity is dominated by out-of-plane flexural phonons with quadratic dispersion, characteristic of two-dimensional layered systems. Compared with crystalline graphite, EG exhibits enhanced heat capacity due to increased defect density and reduced interlayer coupling. Structural characterization (XRD, Raman, EDS) confirmed variations in stacking order and defect concentration. The data were fitted using a three-term model ($C_{1}T + C_{3}T^{3} + C_{5}T^{5}$), where the negative $C_{5}$ term indicates quadratic phonon dispersion. The results demonstrate the influence of MWCNT integration and structural disorder on phonon dynamics and anisotropic heat capacity in EG-based composites.</description>

      <title>The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Impact of Electron Correlations on Infinite-Layer Cuprates and Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of unconventional superconductivity involves a balance of interaction strengths. Precise determination of correlation strength across different material families is therefore important. Here, we present a combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study of infinite-layer PrNiO$_2$ and SrCuO$_2$ that enables fair comparison of their interaction strengths. For both compounds, we study the orbital and magnetic excitations and extract their dispersions along high-symmetry directions. Using a single-band Hubbard model and including higher-order exchange interactions, we derive the correlation factor $U/t$ for both compounds. A key finding is that despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion $U$, PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a correlation strength that is 20% stronger than that of its isostructural cuprate counterpart SrCuO$_2$. This indicates that a moderation of the correlation strength may further optimize superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital-to-charge conversion in noncentrosymmetric materials: Hall versus Rashba-Edelstein effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, treating the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect on an equal footing. We develop a general formalism for this interconversion based solely on macroscopic observables. The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects. Our work redefines the spin- and orbit-to-charge interconversion coefficients in terms of directly measurable observables, encouraging the community to revisit these processes in other quantum materials lacking inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Role of Wadsley Defects and Cation Disorder to Enhance MoNb12O33 Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wadsley-Roth (WR) niobates have emerged as high-rate anode materials that can combine rapid ionic diffusion with good electronic conductivity. WR compounds have been defect-enhanced by limited annealing, however, such materials often contain multiple types of defects. In particular, both Wadsley defects (variable block size) and transition metal disorder have the potential to modify transport rates, however the corresponding effects are not well understood mechanistically. Here, MoNb12O33 (MNO) was calcined at two different temperatures to compare a defect-rich condition (MNO-800) with a proximal order-rich condition (MNO-900) as assessed through XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and STEM characterizations. Galvanostatically cycled lithium half cells of MNO-800 exhibited additional capacity (307 mAh/g at 0.1C, 4.66% higher) and improved high- rate capacity of 200 mAhg-1 at 10C. ICI-based overpotential analysis identified solid state diffusion as the dominant rate limiting process where MNO-800 correspondingly exhibited ~3X faster capacity-weighted diffusivity. A machine-learning interatomic potential was trained to density functional theory and then applied with molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) to examine the possible roles of Wadsley defects and transition metal disorder. For both defect-types, Li was found to populate and activate fast diffusion paths from window sites at lower extents of lithiation as compared to the order-rich model.</description>

      <title>Probing the features of electron dispersion by tunneling between slightly twisted bilayer graphene sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling conductance between two bilayer graphene (BLG) sheets separated by 2 nm-thick insulating barrier was measured in two devices with the twist angles between BLGs less than 1{\deg}. At small bias voltages, the tunneling occurs with conservation of energy and momentum at the points of intersection between two relatively shifted Fermi circles. Here, we experimentally found and theoretically described signatures of electron-hole asymmetric band structure of BLG: since holes are heavier, the tunneling conductance is enhanced at the hole doping due to the higher density of states. Another key feature of BLG that we explore is gap opening in a vertical electric field with a strong polarization of electron wave function at van Hove singularities near the gap edges. This polarization, by shifting electron wave function in one BLG closer to or father from the other BLG, gives rise to asymmetric tunneling resonances in the conductance around charge neutrality points, which result in strong sensitivity of the tunneling current to minor changes of the gate voltages. The observed phenomena are reproduced by our theoretical model taking into account electrostatics of the dual-gated structure, quantum capacitance effects, and self-consistent gap openings in both BLGs.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands anti-crossing at $-3$ eV below the Fermi level in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed cadmium. The linear out-of-plane dispersion is kept up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg arrays, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal weight superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single-mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a `valley-independent Chern number', measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Non-Dissipative Inertial Dynamics of Skyrmion in a Bosonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been understood in the past a decade or two that the dynamics of spin or magnetization in ultrafast regime necessarily involves inertial term that reflects the reluctance to follow abrupt or sudden change in the spin or magnetization orientation. The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the motion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using nonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is derived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a ``minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\omega$, modeling an optical phonon-like bosonic bath with its nearly-flat energy spectrum, and a coupling to the phonon energy density that dominates under resonance condition at the optical phonon frequency. A deterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with an explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due to the coupling, even within rigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with a frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator. Controlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics. Our theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a pathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>The superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions fabricated from structurally chiral Mo$_3$Al$_2$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. Fraunhofer-like magnetic diffraction patterns confirm the presence of Josephson effect in all but one of our devices. A magnetic field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in the right-handed/left-handed devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $I_{c-}$, with a maximum asymmetry of 5\%. The intrinsic superconducting diode effect is not observed in the right-handed/right-handed devices. We provide an explanation for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed devices.</description>

      <title>Cavity-induced coherent magnetization and polaritons in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets feature antiparallel spin sublattices with $d$-, $g$-, or $i$-wave spin order, yielding nonrelativistic spin splitting without net magnetization. We show that embedding a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet in a driven optical cavity induces a finite, tunable magnetization. Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Dominated Thermal Transport and Large Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Topological Semimetal CoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm tot}=\kappa_{\rm L}+\kappa_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d-1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p+1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d-p-2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ being the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. This framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the sum rule, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>A Remarkable Application of Zassenhaus Formula to Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Zassenhaus decomposition for the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting operators, simplifies drastically when these operators satisfy a simple condition, called the no-mixed adjoint property. An important application to a Unitary Coupled Cluster method for strongly correlated electron systems is presented. This ansatz requires no Trotterization and is exact on a quantum computer with a finite number of Givens gate equals to the number of free parameters. The formulas obtained in this work also shed light on why and when optimization after Trotterization gives exact solutions in disentangled forms of unitary coupled cluster.</description>
