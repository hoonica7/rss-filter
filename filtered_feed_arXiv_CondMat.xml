      <title>Lessons from $\alpha$-RuCl3 for pursuing quantum spin liquid physics in atomically thin materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $\alpha$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $\alpha$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $\alpha$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $\alpha$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $\alpha$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Screw-dislocation-engineered quantum dot: geometry-tunable nonlinear optics, orbital qubit addressability, and torsion metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.</description>

      <title>Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Heat Capacity of Thermally Reduced Graphene Oxide: Compaction and Thermal Annealing Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature heat capacity of thermally reduced graphene oxide (trGO) as a function of compaction pressure and annealing temperature. Graphene oxide was synthesized using a modified Hummers method and subsequently thermally reduced at 300\,{\deg}C, 500\,{\deg}C, and 700\,{\deg}C under vacuum to systematically vary the oxygen content and structural ordering. The specific heat data in the 2--300\,K range reveal that the thermal response is governed by phonons, including contributions from a Schottky-type anomaly, a defect-related linear term, a Debye term, and a dispersive term with a negative coefficient associated with out-of-plane flexural (ZA) phonons. Increasing compaction pressure alters interlayer coupling and leads to non-monotonic changes in heat capacity, while higher annealing temperatures enhance graphitization, reduce disorder, and modify phonon dispersion. The absence of a boson peak -- similar to that observed in carbon nanotubes -- supports the dominance of two-dimensional vibrational modes. These findings elucidate the relationship between dimensionality, structural disorder, and processing parameters in shaping the phonon dynamics of trGO, providing guidance for tailoring its thermal behavior in advanced carbon-based functional materials.</description>

      <title>Stability of current-carrying states in hard-core bosons with long-range hopping on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of current-carrying states with quasi-momentum $K$ in the Bose-condensed phase of the hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice, where particles transfer between two sites separated by distance $r$ with hopping amplitude decaying algebraically with $r$ as $\propto r^{-\alpha}$. Using a mean-field theory, we analyze the excitation spectrum and determine the critical quasi-momenta associated with Landau and dynamical instabilities. We find that the long-range hopping suppresses the critical quasi-momenta and makes them vanish at $\alpha=3$. Near $\alpha=3$, we show that the critical quasi-momentum $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the dynamical instability exhibits the scaling behavior $K_\mathrm{c} \propto \Delta^{1+\Delta}$ with $\Delta=\alpha-3$, where the scaling exponent explicitly depends on $\Delta$, as a consequence of the long-range nature of the hopping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a neural network impurity solver for real-frequency DMFT that employs a multihead cross-attention mechanism to map hybridization functions to spectral functions, conditioned on impurity parameters. Trained on high-quality MPS data from complex contour time evolution and incorporating derivative constraints with respect to the complex-time angle, our model achieves smooth generalization to the real-frequency axis. Benchmarking on the single-band Hubbard model for the Bethe lattice demonstrates quantitative accuracy across metallic, strongly correlated, and insulating regimes.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling Driven Correlated and Charge-Ordered Electronic States in a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and Fermi-surface expansion induced by van Hove-driven ferromagnetic fluctuations: the D-TRILEX analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.</description>

      <title>From Random Determinants to the Ground State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ans\"atze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems. The compact explicit wavefunctions it produces further enable direct and rapid evaluation of observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral phonons are desirable for applications in spintronics but their generation and control remains a challenge.Here we demonstrate the emergence of truly chiral phonons from selective magnon-phonon coupling in inversion-symmetric magnetic systems. Considering bcc Fe as example, we quantitatively calculate hybridized magnon-phonon quasiparticle states across the entire Brillouin zone utilizing first-principles calculations. Our findings challenge conventional magneto-elastic interpretations and reveal finite zero-point phonon angular momentum and strong anomalous thermal Hall responses linked to finite (spin) Berry curvatures. Our results further establish that the existence of chiral phonons, particularly along high-symmetry directions, is common in many magnetic materials, offering promising avenues for novel spintronic and phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Emergent Pair Density Wave Order Across a Lifshitz Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized t-J model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.</description>

      <title>Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagom\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom\'e bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom\'e bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom\'e as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Fractional Chern Insulator Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of fractional Chern insulator stabilization against charge-ordered states. We argue that the phase competition is captured by an effective interaction range, which depends on both the bare interaction range and quantum geometric properties. We argue that short effective interaction ranges stabilize fractional states while longer-range interactions favor charge-ordered states. To confirm our hypothesis, we conduct a numerical study of the generalized Hofstadter model using the density matrix renormalization group. Our theory offers a new interpretation of the geometric stability hypothesis and generalizes it, providing a unifying framework for several approaches to fractional phase stabilization. Finally, we propose a route towards experimental verification of the theory and possible implications for fractional states in bands with higher Chern numbers.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2 illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg spot with a change in handedness establishes a chiral signature for the fully compensated collinear antiferromagnet. The signature is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric quadrupole (E2) axial absorption events. Polar E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established MnF2 magnetic symmetry. It is compatible with atomic altermagnetism, and the corresponding order parameter contributes to E2-E2 and magnetic neutron Bragg diffraction patterns. Moreover, spin-flip patterns from polarized neutron diffraction depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests of the actual electronic structure.</description>

Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>
