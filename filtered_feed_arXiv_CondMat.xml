      <title>Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Analysis of Strongly Correlated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an exceptionally powerful tool for analyzing scientific data. In particular, attention-based architectures have demonstrated a remarkable capability to capture complex correlations and to furnish interpretable insights into latent, otherwise inconspicuous patterns. This progress motivates the application of AI techniques to the analysis of strongly correlated electrons, which remain notoriously challenging to study using conventional theoretical approaches. Here, we propose novel AI workflows for analyzing snapshot datasets from tensor-network simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model over a broad range of temperature and doping. The 2D Hubbard model is an archetypal strongly correlated system, hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous metals, and high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our AI techniques yield fresh perspectives on the intricate quantum correlations underpinning these phenomena and facilitate universal omnimetry for ultracold-atom simulations of the corresponding strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Fermiology in bulk moir\'e metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, moir\'e materials have revolutionized how we engineer and control quantum phases of matter. Among incommensurate materials, moir\'e materials are aperiodic composite crystals whose long-wavelength moir\'e superlattices enable tunable properties without chemically modifying their layers. To date, nearly all reports of moir\'e materials have investigated van der Waals heterostructures assembled far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here we introduce a conceptually new approach to synthesizing high-mobility moir\'e materials in thermodynamic equilibrium. We report a new family of foliated superlattice materials (Sr$_6$TaS$_8$)$_{1+\delta}$(TaS$_2$)$_8$ that are exfoliatable van der Waals crystals with atomically incommensurate lattices. Lattice mismatches between alternating layers generate moir\'e superlattices, analogous to those of 2D moir\'e heterobilayers, that are coherent throughout these crystals and are tunable through their synthesis conditions without altering their chemical composition. High-field quantum oscillation measurements map the complex Fermiology of these moir\'e metals, which can be tuned via the moir\'e superlattice structure. We find that the Fermi surface of the structurally simplest moir\'e metal is comprised of over 40 distinct cross-sectional areas, the most observed in any material to our knowledge. This can be naturally understood by postulating that bulk moir\'e materials can encode electronic properties of higher-dimensional superspace crystals in ways that parallel well-established crystallographic methods used for incommensurate lattices. More broadly, our work demonstrates a scalable synthesis approach potentially capable of producing moir\'e materials for electronics applications and evidences a novel material design concept for accessing a broad range of physical phenomena proposed in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>MaterialsGalaxy: A Platform Fusing Experimental and Theoretical Data in Condensed Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern materials science generates vast and diverse datasets from both experiments and computations, yet these multi-source, heterogeneous data often remain disconnected in isolated "silos". Here, we introduce MaterialsGalaxy, a comprehensive platform that deeply fuses experimental and theoretical data in condensed matter physics. Its core innovation is a structure similarity-driven data fusion mechanism that quantitatively links cross-modal records - spanning diffraction, crystal growth, computations, and literature - based on their underlying atomic structures. The platform integrates artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction, generative models for crystal structure prediction, and machine learning property predictors, to enhance data interpretation and accelerate materials discovery. We demonstrate that MaterialsGalaxy effectively integrates these disparate data sources, uncovering hidden correlations and guiding the design of novel materials. By bridging the long-standing gap between experiment and theory, MaterialsGalaxy provides a new paradigm for data-driven materials research and accelerates the discovery of advanced materials.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced superconductivity and emerging topological phases in altermagnet-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for investigating superconducting proximity effect in altermagnet (AM)-superconductor (SC) heterostructures. In general, AMs, characterized by vanishing net magnetization but spin-split electronic spectra, provide a promising platform for realizing unconventional magnetic phases. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave AM proximity coupled to a three dimensional ordinary $s$-wave SC. By integrating out the superconducting degrees of freedom, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that describes the proximity-induced modifications in the AM layer in the form of a self-energy. We then derive an effective Green's function to obtain the proximity-induced pairing amplitudes in the AM layer and classify the induced pairing amplitudes according to their parity, frequency, and spin. We find the presence of even-parity singlet and triplet pairing amplitudes in the AM layer. To achieve the odd-parity triplet components, important to realize topological superconductivity, we introduce a layer of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in the heterostructure. We analyse the band topology of this proximity-induced AM-RSOC layer and demonstrate the emergence of both weak and strong topological superconducting phases with edge-localized modes, characterized by winding number and Chern number. These findings highlight the role of AM-SC hybrid setup as a versatile platform for realizing odd-parity triplet pairings and engineering topological superconductivity in two-dimension.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Network Backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately describing the ground state of strongly correlated systems is essential for understanding their emergent properties. Neural Network Backflow (NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions by introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle orbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large networks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size. Instead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant ansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant expansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In particular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques, benchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied to alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard model near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo, and projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving state-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected symmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy. Using this technique we report the lowest variational energies for this Hamiltonian on $4\times 16$ and $4 \times 8$ lattices as well as accurate variance extrapolated energies. We also show the evolution of spin, charge, and pair correlation functions as the quality of the variational ansatz improves.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion modeling protocols for improving the Kikuchi pattern indexing in electron back-scatter diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>The Anderson transition -- a view from Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerical methods that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. We revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in Krylov superoperator subspace, and can be analytically constructed, given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs (in Krylov space) with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states). Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected fractal exponent.</description>

      <title>Engineering Biquadratic Interactions in Spin-1 Chains by Spin-1/2 Spacers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains. Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However, many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its strength $\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\beta$ is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the spacer spins. Increasing this ratio first increases the magnitude of $\beta$ and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity of moir\'e heavy fermions in MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable Kondo lattice and heavy fermion physics have been recently reported in moir\'e materials, but most of the studies have focused on the electrical and magnetic properties. Quantitative thermoelectric measurements, which can reveal entropic information of the heavy fermions, have yet to be achieved. Here, we report a comprehensive thermoelectric study on the moir\'e heavy fermion phase realized in hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. By electrically gating the material to the Kondo lattice region of the phase diagram, we observe a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo coherence temperature, where the heavy fermion phase with an electron-like Fermi surface evolves into an itinerant Fermi liquid with a hole-like Fermi surface. We compare the results with the semiclassical Mott relation and discuss the observed discrepancies. In addition to the thermal dissociation of Kondo singlets in the heavy Fermi liquid, a sign change accompanied by a strong peak in the Seebeck coefficient is also observed near a Zeeman breakdown of the Kondo singlets, signaling an entropy accumulation. Our results provide entropic information on both the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moir\'e semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O at millikelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons in the semiconductor Cu$_2$O have been observed in absorption experiments up to a principal quantum number of n = 28 at millikelvin temperatures [1]. Here, we extend the experimental parameter space by variing both temperature and excitation power. In particular, we show that the P excitons close to the band gap react more sensitively to an increase of the excitation power than states of the associated D exciton multiplet, even though the latter are located at comparatively higher energy. This finding is similar to the one observed when applying an external electric field, suggesting that the observed behavior arises from internal electric fields created by charged impurities that are optically ionized. At laser intensities below 1 $\mu$W/cm$^2$, absorption lines of excitons with n=29 are observed.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Skyrmion Flow Phases with Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful method that can identify patterns in large, complex data sets by constructing low-dimensional order parameters from higher-dimensional feature vectors. There are increasing efforts to use space-and-time-dependent PCA to detect transitions in nonequilibrium systems that are difficult to characterize with equilibrium methods. Here, we demonstrate that feature vectors incorporating the position and velocity information of driven skyrmions moving through random disorder permit PCA to resolve different types of disordered skyrmion motion as a function of driving force and the ratio of the Magnus force to the dissipation. Since the Magnus force creates gyroscopic motion and a finite Hall angle, skyrmions can exhibit a greater range of flow phases than what is observed in overdamped driven systems with quenched disorder. We show that in addition to identifying previously known skyrmion flow phases, PCA detects several additional phases, including different types of channel flow, moving fluids, and partially ordered states. Guided by the PCA analysis, we further characterize the disordered flow phases to elucidate the different microscopic dynamics and show that the changes in the PCA-derived order parameters can be connected to features in bulk transport measures, including the transverse and longitudinal velocity-force curves, differential conductivity, topological defect density, and changes in the skyrmion Hall angle as a function of drive. We discuss how asymmetric feature vectors can be used to improve the resolution of the PCA analysis, and how this technique can be extended to find disordered phases in other nonequilibrium systems with time-dependent dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198, our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under experimentally feasible electric biases.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Sn-based Halide Perovskites: Insights from MACE-MP-0 and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tin-based halide perovskites have emerged as promising lead-free alternatives for optoelectronic applications, yet their structural stability and phase behavior at finite temperatures remain challenging to predict. Here, we assess the predictive capabilities of the foundational machine learning model MACE-MP-0 - trained on a broad chemical space and applied without system-specific fine-tuning - for the temperature-dependent behavior of CsSnBr3 and Cs2SnBr6. Molecular Dynamics simulations in the NpT ensemble were performed from 100 K to 500 K, and thermodynamic and structural descriptors including enthalpy, specific heat, radial distribution functions, translational order, bond angle distributions, and vibrational spectra were analyzed. Our results show that CsSnBr3 undergoes a low-temperature orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transition, evidenced by both the evolution of lattice parameters and subtle anomalies in enthalpy and specific heat, although the experimentally observed intermediate tetragonal phase is not captured. In contrast, Cs2SnBr6 remains cubic and maintains a more rigid octahedral framework across the entire temperature range. Overall, MACE-MP-0 qualitatively reproduces key thermal and structural features of these materials, highlighting its usefulness as a first step for studying new materials. For cases where capturing more subtle phase behavior is required, system-specific fine-tuning with Density Functional Theory data should be considered.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in ultrafast laser systems and high harmonic generation (HHG) techniques have enabled time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on femtosecond timescales, opening up unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum materials in both time and momentum space. In this review, we present recent representative studies utilizing HHG-laser-based time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for a variety of quantum materials. We particularly highlight electron-phonon interactions and non-equilibrium dynamics in time and frequency domain, through which rich information about non-equilibrium electron-phonon couplings and related phenomena has been clearly revealed.</description>

      <title>Kink in Stoner Factor as a Signature of Changing Magnetic Fluctuations in Organic Conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We have employed a four-band model, where each BETS molecule is considered as a site, and a two-band model, treating each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around $T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, indicating a change in the dominant magnetic fluctuations. Above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, it shows a broad structure indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, while below $T_\mathrm{kink}$, the spin susceptibility peaks at a wavevector corresponding to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations. As the intra-dimer transfer integral increases, the kink disappears, and the AFM fluctuations are enhanced. Our findings are consistent with experimental observations, which also report a change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.</description>

      <title>Crossover between intrinsic and temperature-assisted regimes in spin-orbit torque switching of antiferromagnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive studies have been made on antiferromagnets as candidate materials for next generation memory bits due to their ultrafast dynamics reaching picosecond time scales. Recent demonstrations of electrical bidirectional switching of antiferromagnetic states have attracted significant attention. However, under the presence of significant Joule heating that destabilizes the magnetic order, the timescales associated with the switching can be limited to nanoseconds or longer. Here, we present the observation of a crossover in the switching behavior of the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn by tuning the magnetic layer thickness. While Joule heating interferes with switching in thicker devices, we find clear signatures of an intrinsic spin-orbit torque mechanism as the thickness is reduced, avoiding the heating effect. The suppression of heating enables switching without significant attenuation of the readout signal using pulses shorter than those required by temperature-assisted mechanisms. The crossover into the spin-orbit torque switching behavior clarifies the potential for achieving ultrafast switching as expected from the picosecond spin dynamics of antiferromagnets. Our results lay the groundwork for designing antiferromagnetic memory devices that can operate at ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Absence of Parity Anomaly in Massive Dirac Fermions on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions has shaped perspectives in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. In condensed matter it has evolved as a mechanism for half-quantized Hall responses in systems described by massive Dirac fermions. Here we reexamine the issue on a lattice and show that the half-quantized Hall conductivity is absent for massive Dirac fermions when lattice regularization is properly implemented and the translational invariant symmetry is taken into account. We realize that a single massive Dirac cone on a lattice always leads to an integer quantized Hall conductivity and to the half-quantized Hall conductivity only in the unphysical limit of infinite momentum cut-off. The half-quantized Hall conductivity appears with nonzero longitudinal conductance as a signature of a single massless Dirac cone on a lattice. Consequently, the parity anomaly is a property of massless Dirac fermions in a semimetal/metal, not of massive Dirac fermions in an insulator on a lattice.</description>

      <title>High thermal conductivity of rutile-GeO$_2$ films grown by MOCVD: $52.9~\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile germanium dioxide (r-GeO2) has recently emerged as a promising ultrawide-bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor owing to its wide bandgap (~4.4-5.1 eV), ambipolar doping potential, and high theoretical thermal conductivity. However, experimental data on the thermal conductivity of r-GeO2 epitaxial layers have not been reported, primarily due to challenges in phase control and surface roughness. Here, we report a high thermal conductivity of 52.9 +/- 6.6 W m^-1 K^-1 for high-quality (002) r-GeO2 films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterized using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR). The phase control was achieved through a seed-driven stepwise crystallization (SDSC) approach, and the surface roughness was significantly reduced from 76 nm to 16 nm (locally as low as 1 A) via chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). These results highlight the promise of r-GeO2 as a UWBG oxide platform for power electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of Anomalous Hall and Nernst Responses in Potassium Tri Vanadium Pentantimonide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the anomalous Nernst and Hall conductance in the Kagome metal potassium tri vanadium pentantimonide, based on a system Hamiltonian incorporating nearest neighbour and complex next nearest neighbour hopping, Rashba spin orbit coupling, an exchange field induced by magnetic proximity, and a charge density wave potential. Our analysis reveals that the Nernst conductivity exhibits a non monotonic temperature dependence. It increases with temperature, reaches a pronounced peak, and subsequently declines at higher temperatures due to thermal broadening, which diminishes the influence of Berry curvature. Notably, small shifts in the chemical potential can lead to dramatic changes in the Nernst signal enhancing its magnitude or even reversing its sign highlighting the system sensitivity to carrier density. We further explore the anomalous Hall behaviour within this framework. The band structure hosts multiple bands with nonzero Berry curvature, and preliminary Chern number calculations suggest weak topological features, namely, while not fully quantized, the system exhibits significant Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum space winding, implemented via a momentum dependent phase in the complex hopping terms to mimic orbital magnetic flux, we observe that two bands acquire opposite Chern numbers. The remaining bands remain topologically trivial.</description>

      <title>First-principles design of excitonic insulators: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitonic insulator (EI) is a more than 60-year-old theoretical proposal that yet remains elusive. It is a purely quantum phenomenon involving the spontaneous generation of excitons in quantum mechanics and the spontaneous condensation of excitons in quantum statistics. At this point, the excitons represent the ground state rather than the conventional excited state. Thus, the scarcity of candidate materials is a key factor contributing to the lack of recognized EI to date. In this review, we begin with the birth of EI, presenting the current state of the field and the main challenges it faces. We then focus on recent advances in the discovery and design of EIs based on the first-principles Bethe-Salpeter scheme, in particular the dark-exciton rule guided screening of materials. It not only opens up new avenues for realizing excitonic instability in direct-gap and wide-gap semiconductors, but also leads to the discovery of novel quantum states of matter such as half-EIs and spin-triplet EIs. Finally, we will look ahead to possible research pathways leading to the first recognized EI, both computationally and theoretically.</description>

      <title>Ground states of a family of frustrated spin models for quasicrystals and their approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.</description>

      <title>Single femtosecond laser pulse-driven ferromagnetic switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered, as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Influence of Hydrogen-Incorporation on the Bulk Electronic Structure and Chemical Bonding in Palladium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palladium hydride is a model system for studying metal-hydrogen interactions. Yet, its bulk electronic structure has proven difficult to directly probe, with most studies to date limited to surface-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy approaches. This work reports the first in-situ ambient-pressure hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-HAXPES) study of hydrogen incorporation in Pd thin films, providing direct access to bulk chemical and electronic information at elevated hydrogen pressures. Structural characterisation by in-situ X-ray diffraction and neutron reflectometry under comparable conditions establishes a direct correlation between hydrogen loading, lattice expansion, and electronic modifications. Comparison with density functional theory (DFT) reveals how hydrogen stoichiometry and site occupancy govern the density of occupied states near the Fermi level. These results resolve long-standing questions regarding PdH and establish AP-HAXPES as a powerful tool for probing the bulk electronic structure of metal hydrides under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics in chiral tellurium by linear and circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy: crystal orientation and handedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal tellurium (Te) has attracted researchers' attention due to its transport and optical properties, which include electrical magneto-chiral anisotropy, spin polarization and bulk photovoltaic effect. It is the anisotropic and chiral crystal structure of Te that drive these properties, so the determination of its crystallographic orientation and handedness is key to their study. Here we explore the structural dynamics of Te bulk crystals by angle-dependent linearly polarized Raman spectroscopy and symmetry rules in three different crystallographic orientations. The angle-dependent intensity of the modes allows us to determine the arrangement of the helical chains and distinguish between crystallographic planes parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis. Furthermore, under different configurations of circularly polarized Raman measurements and crystal orientations, we observe the shift of two phonon modes only in the (0 0 1) plane. The shift is positive or negative depending on the handedness of the crystals, which we determine univocally by chemical etching. Our analysis of three different crystal faces of Te highlights the importance of selecting the proper orientation and crystallographic plane when investigating the transport and optical properties of this material. These results offer insight into the crystal structure and symmetry in other anisotropic and chiral materials, and open new paths to select a suitable crystal orientation when fabricating devices.</description>

      <title>Fate and origin of the quantum Otto heat engine based on the dissipative Dicke-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dicke-Hubbard model, describing an ensemble of interacting atoms in a cavity, provides a rich platform for exploring collective quantum phenomena. However, its potential for quantum thermodynamic applications remains largely uncharted. Here, we study a quantum Otto heat engine whose working substance is a system governed by the Dicke-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Through the research on steady-state superradiance phase transitions, it is demonstrated that the steady-state synergistic mechanism under high and low temperature environments is the reason for the emergence of high-performance heat engines. By analyzing the influences of atom-light coupling strength, inter-cavity hopping strength and atom number on the working modes of quantum Otto cycle, it is clarified that the effective working regions of each working mode. This work has established a close connection between superradiance phase transition and the quantum thermodynamic applications. It not only deepens our understanding of the energy conversion mechanism in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics but also lays a theoretical foundation for the future experimental design of high-performance quantum Otto heat engines.</description>

      <title>First-Order Spin-Reorientation Transition and Incomplete Softening of the Antiferromagnetic Resonance Mode in Multiferroic GdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiferroic ferroborate GdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ with huntite-type structure exhibits magnetic ordering below T$_N$ = 38 K and contains two magnetic subsystems associated with Gd and Fe ions. Competing anisotropies of these subsystems drive a spin reorientation transition at T$_{SR}$ = 10.7 K, switching the ground state from easy-axis to easy-plane. Using antiferromagnetic resonance, we investigate the spin dynamics across this transition. The observed incomplete softening of a magnon mode during both field- and temperature-induced spin-reorientation transitions indicates the first-order nature of the phase transition, which is accompanied by a discontinuous jump in the effective anisotropy field. We reproduce this behavior using a simple model that attributes the jump in the anisotropy field to the presence of an effective fourth-order anisotropy constant, responsible for the discontinuous character of the transition. Remarkably, for in-plane magnetic fields, we identify a new AFMR mode that persists from 12 K up to T$_N$. This mode likely corresponds to the dynamics of a long period incommensurate state, previously detected by resonant elastic X-ray scattering.</description>

Abstract: Multiorbital Hubbard models with Hund coupling and crystal-field splitting exhibit an instability toward spin-triplet excitonic order in the parameter regime characterized by strong local spin fluctuations. Upon chemical doping, two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of thermal transport at metal/silicon interfaces: evidence of interfacial electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing miniaturization of electronic components and the need to optimize thermal management, it has become essential to understand heat transport at metal/semiconductor interfaces. While it has been recognized decades ago that an electron phonon channel may take place at metal-semiconductor interfaces, its existence is still controversial. Here, we investigate thermal transport at metal-silicon interfaces using the combination of first principles calculations and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF). We explain how to correct NEGF formalism to account for the out of equilibrium nature of the energy carriers in the vicinity of the interface. The relative corrections to the equilibrium distribution are shown to arise from the spectral mean free paths of silicon and may reach 15 percents. Applying these corrections, we compare the predictions of NEGF to available experimental data for Au/Si, Pt/Si and Al/Si interfaces. Based on this comparison, we infer the value of the electron phonon interfacial thermal conductance by employing the two temperature model. We find that interfacial thermal transport at Au/Si interfaces is mainly driven by phonon phonon processes, and that electron phonon processes play a negligible role in this case. By contrast, for Al/Si interfaces, we show that phonon-phonon scattering alone can not explain the experimental values reported so far, and we estimate that the electron-phonon interfacial conductance accounts for one third of the total conductance. This work demonstrates the importance of the electron-phonon conductance at metal-silicon interfaces and calls for systematic experimental investigation of thermal transport at these interfaces at low temperatures. It paves the way for an accurate model to predict the conductance associated to the interfacial electron phonon channel.</description>

      <title>Ground State Excitations and Energy Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass in dimensions two and higher against perturbations of a single coupling. After reviewing the concepts of critical droplets, flexibilities and metastates, we show that, in any dimension, a certain kind of critical droplet with space-filling (i.e., positive spatial density) boundary does not exist in ground states generated by coupling-independent boundary conditions. Using this we show that if incongruent ground states exist in any dimension, the variance of their energy difference restricted to finite volumes scales proportionally to the volume. This in turn is used to prove that a metastate generated by (e.g.) periodic boundary conditions is unique and supported on a single pair of spin-reversed ground states in two dimensions. We further show that a type of excitation above a ground state, whose interface with the ground state is space-filling and whose energy remains O(1) independent of the volume, as predicted by replica symmetry breaking, cannot exist in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Molecular ink-based synthesis of Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions as tuneable materials for sustainable energy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (Q-1D) van der Waals chalcohalides have emerged as promising materials for advanced energy applications, combining tunable optoelectronic properties and composed by earth-abundant and non-toxic elements. However, their widespread application remains hindered by challenges such as anisotropic crystal growth, composition control and lack of knowledge on optoelectronic properties. A deeper understanding of the intrinsic limitations of these materials, as well as viable defect mitigation strategies like the engineering of solid solutions, is critical. This work presents a low-temperature synthesis route based on molecular ink deposition enabling direct crystallization of tunable Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions without need for binary chalcogenide precursors. This approach yields phase-pure films with precise control over morphology, composition, and crystallographic orientation. XRD analysis and DFT calculations confirm the formation of homogeneous solid solutions, while optoelectronic measurements reveal the distinct roles of halogen and chalcogen anions in tuning bandgap energy and carrier type, with Se shifting downwards the conduction band. The versatility of this synthesis technique enables morphology control ranging from compact films to rod-shaped microcrystals, expanding the functional adaptability of these materials. These findings offer a foundational framework for defect engineering and the scalable integration of chalcohalides in next-generation energy technologies, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of organic-inorganic perovskite and all-inorganic lead-free double perovskite nanocrystals by femtosecond laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite materials are at the forefront of modern materials science due to their exceptional structural, electronic, and optical properties. The controlled fabrication of perovskite nanostructures is crucial for enhancing their performance, stability, and scalability, directly impacting their applications in next-generation devices such as solar cells, LEDs, and sensors. Here, we present a novel, ligand-free approach to synthesize perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with average sizes up to 100 nm, using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in ambient air without additional liquid media. We demonstrate this method for both organic-inorganic (methylamino lead) hybrid perovskites (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) and fully inorganic lead-free double perovskites (Cs2AgBiX6, X = Cl, Br), achieving high-purity NCs without stabilizing ligands - a critical advancement over conventional chemical synthesis methods. By tailoring laser parameters, we systematically elucidate the influence of perovskite composition (halide type, organic vs. inorganic cation, single versus double perovskite structure) on the ablation process and the resulting nanocrystal properties. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirm the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX3 forming larger (approximately 90 nm) cubic NCs and Cs2AgBiX6 forming smaller (approximately 10 nm) rounded NCs. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals pronounced size-dependent blue shifts (17-40 nm) due to quantum confinement, particularly for Br and I containing perovskites. This clean, scalable, and versatile PLA approach not only provides direct access to high-purity, ligand-free perovskite NCs with tunable optical properties but also represents a significant advance in the fabrication of nanostructures, enabling the exploration of new perovskite-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of Transition Metal Doped in 2D Polyaramid for Novel Material Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first--principles density functional theory (DFT) study of transition metal (TM = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) functionalized two--dimensional polyaramid (2DPA) to explore their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Mechanical parameters, such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Pugh ratio, together with phonon dispersion, confirm the mechanical and dynamic stability of all doped systems. Electronic structure analysis shows strong binding of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ti with formation energies between --1.15 eV and --2.96 eV, while Mn binds more weakly (--0.67 eV). TM doping introduces new electronic states that reduce the band gap, with Fe-doped 2DPA exhibiting the lowest value of 0.26 eV. The systems display predominantly ferromagnetic ordering, with magnetic moments of 1.14 {\mu}B (Co), 3.57 {\mu}B (Cr), 2.26 {\mu}B (Fe), 4.19 {\mu}B (Mn), and 1.62 {\mu}B (Ti). These results demonstrate that TM--doped 2DPA possesses tunable magnetic and electronic characteristics, highlighting its potential for spintronic applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of $R$Rh$_6$Ge$_4$ ($R$ = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd - Er) were synthesized using a Bi flux and their physical properties were characterized by magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat measurements. These compounds crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric LiCo$_6$P$_4$-type structure (space group $P\bar{6}m2$), where rare-earth atoms form a triangular lattice in the $ab$-plane and chains along the $c$-axis. PrRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and ErRh$_6$Ge$_4$ do not exhibit magnetic transitions above 0.4 K. NdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$ are ferromagnets, while GdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ show antiferromagnetic transitions, \red{whereas HoRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is a ferrimagnet}. In addition, DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ shows multiple transitions and magnetization plateaus when a magnetic field is applied along the $c$-axis. In SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$, like the Ce counterpart, the crystalline-electric field (CEF) effect leads to an easy plane anisotropy, while in other compounds it gives rise to a pronounced uniaxial anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Kinematical and dynamical contrast of dislocations in thick GaN substrates observed by synchrotron-radiation X-ray topography under six-beam diffraction conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in a thick ammonothermal GaN substrate were investigated using synchrotron-radiation X-ray topography (SR-XRT) under six-beam diffraction conditions. The high brilliance of the synchrotron source enabled the observation of the super-Borrmann effect, which markedly enhanced the anomalous transmission of X-rays through the 350~$\mu$m-thick crystal. Systematic variation of the deviation angle~$\Delta\omega$ revealed a clear transition from kinematical to dynamical diffraction, consistent with theoretical predictions based on dynamical diffraction theory. By selectively exciting five equivalent two-beam diffraction conditions near the six-beam configuration, the Burgers vectors of individual threading edge dislocations (TEDs) were determined according to the $g\cdot b$ invisibility criterion. The measured dislocation image widths agreed well with calculated values derived from the extinction distance and $|g\cdot b|$ dependence, confirming that most dislocations possess Burgers vectors containing an $a$-type component of $\frac{1}{3}\langle 11\bar{2}0\rangle$ or $\frac{2}{3}\langle 11\bar{2}0\rangle$. These results demonstrate that SR-XRT under multibeam diffraction provides a powerful, nondestructive method for quantitative dislocation analysis in thick GaN crystals, offering valuable insights into defect structures critical for high-performance GaN-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Reducing the strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable discovery of high temperature superconductivity in bulk bilayer nickelates under high pressure has prompted the conjecture that epitaxial compressive strain might mimic essential aspects of hydrostatic pressure. The successful realization of superconductivity in films on SrLaAlO4 (001) (SLAO) supports this correspondence, yet it remains unclear whether the rich pressure-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates can be systematically mapped (and studied at ambient pressure) as a function of epitaxial strain. To this end, experimental access near the elusive edge of the superconducting phase boundary would provide invaluable insight into the nature of the superconducting state and the ground state from which it emerges. It would also offer a benchmark for theoretical models. Here we report superconducting bilayer nickelates grown on LaAlO3 (001) (LAO), where the compressive strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity is nearly halved to -1.2%. These films exhibit a superconducting onset above 10 K and reach zero resistance at 3 K, with normal-state transport properties differing from those of films grown on SLAO. Our results offer a new opportunity to probe emergent phenomena near the superconducting phase boundary in the strain-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Magnetoresistance in the magnetic topological semimetals NdSbxTe2-x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological semimetals LnSbTe (Ln = lanthanide elements) provide a platform to study the interplay of structure, magnetism, topology, and electron correlations. Varying Sb and Te compositions in LnSbxTe2-x can effectively control the electronic, magnetic, and transport properties. Here, we report the evolution of transport properties with Sb and Te contents in NdSbxTe2-x, (0 &lt; x &lt; 1). Our work reveals nonmonotonic evolution in magnetoresistance with varying composition stoichiometry. Specifically, reducing Sb content x leads to strong negative magnetoresistance up to 99.9%. Such a strong magnetoresistance, which is likely attributed to the interplay between structure, magnetism, and electronic bands, establishes this material as a promising platform for investigating topological semimetal for future device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate characteristics of a bosonic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state in a one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM) with a static tilt. In the large tilt limit, quenched kinetic energy leads to emergent dipole moment conservation, enabling mapping to a model generating FQH states. Using exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, and an analytical transfer matrix approach, we analyze energy and entanglement properties to reveal FQH correlations. Our findings set the stage for the use of quenched kinetics in simple time-reversal invariant eBHMs to explore emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Programmable digital quantum simulation of 2D Fermi-Hubbard dynamics using 72 superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Zitterbewegung Effect and Quantum Geometry in Non-Hermitian Exciton-Polariton Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Spin Transition at Single Particle Level in Levitating Spin Crossover Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control and understand the phase transitions of individual nanoscale building blocks is key to advancing the next generation of low-power reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. To address this critical challenge, molecular nanoparticles (NPs) exhibiting a spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon are trapped by coupling a quadrupole Paul trap with a multi-spectral polarization-resolved scattering microscope. This contact-free platform simultaneously confines, optically excites, and monitors the spin transition in Fe(II)-triazole NPs in a pressure-tunable environment, eliminating substrate artifacts. Thus, we show light-driven manipulation of the spin transition in levitating NPs free from substrate-induced effects. Using the robust spin bistability near room temperature of our SCO system, we quantify reversible opto-volumetric changes of up to 6%, revealing precise switching thresholds at the single-particle level. Independent pressure modulation produces a comparable size increase, confirming mechanical control over the same bistable transition. These results constitute full real-time control and readout of spin states in levitating SCO NPs, charting a route toward their integration into ultralow-power optical switches, data-storage elements, and nanoscale sensors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic wideband VHF localized field probe using magnon polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here an optimisation and demonstration of a wide band instrument capable of measuring localised and directionally alternated magnetic fields below pT in the very high frequency (VHF) range. We take advantage of the magnon-photon hybridization between a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a copper resonant cavity to employ a resonant heterodyne detection scheme. The measurement is near instantaneous due to the strong coupling attained between magnons and photons.In this work measurements are reported showing a significant widening of the measurement bandwidth, obtained by tuning the YIG Larmor frequency with a bias magnetic field and adjusting the magnon-photon coupling strength. Minimum sensitivity in the sub pT regime is demonstrated in the range 150 -- 225 MHz at room temperature and expected to go to fT in cryogenic temperatures. Dynamic range is estimated to be above 100 dB. The sensitivity is found to be independent on size, being ready to in-chip miniaturization. Such device can be an important building block to quantum circuits, such as baluns, transducers or signal processing units.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium physics through the two-body Bell correlator</title>

Abstract: Identifying equilibrium criticalities and phases from the dynamics of a system, known as a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), is a challenging task when relying solely on local observables. We exhibit that the experimentally accessible two-body Bell operator, originally designed to detect nonlocal correlations in quantum states, serves as an effective witness of DQPTs in a long-range (LR) XY spin chain subjected to a magnetic field, where the interaction strength decays as a power law. Following a sudden quench of the system parameters, the Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins exhibits a distinct drop at the critical boundaries. In this study, we consider two quenching protocols, namely sudden quenches of the magnetic field strength and the interaction fall-off rate. This pronounced behavior defines a threshold, distinguishing intra-phase from inter-phase quenches, remaining valid regardless of the strength of long-range interactions, anisotropy, and system sizes. Comparative analyses further demonstrate that conventional classical and quantum correlators, including entanglement, fail to capture this transition during dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep learning denoising unlocks quantitative insights in operando materials microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization. Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.</description>

      <title>The microscopic origin of the Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology is key in describing unconventional quantum phases of matter and devising robust quantum technology. Exactly how topology mixes with quantum mechanics remains largely unclear, as testified by the lack of a unifying microscopic theory for the ever-expanding and still puzzling transport behavior of electrons in the Quantum Hall Effect. Here we formulate a microscopic theory able to quantitatively describe the large wealth of Quantum Hall physics starting from one basic assumption, that the topological constraint in actual space leads to a superposition of states in the associated angular space. This allows us to identify the mechanism underlying quantum topology, single-particle wavefunction regularity in 3D, while many-body physics and disorder play no fundamental role. Our findings introduce a new far-reaching perspective in analyzing topological quantum systems and applications, such as topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Fock-Darwin states in a circular n-p junction of topological surface states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze and observe the Fock-Darwin (FD) states in a circular n-p junction (CNPJ) of topological surface states. Theoretically, in the CNPJ induced by the sub-surface point charge, the FD states of Dirac fermions are found to have a unique core-shell structure of trapped electrons and holes. The interplay between them is highly tunable by the magnetic field, which has no analog in their conventional counterparts and even in FD states of Dirac fermions confined by the most-studied parabolic-like potentials. A modified Einstein-Brillouin-Keller method is introduced to derive the electron-core states semiclassically. Experimentally, we obtain the clearly resolved FD states of topological surface states up to 14 Tesla which are very different from those of conventional electrons. Our data also visualizes directly directly the field-dependent potential landscape that may be modified by the electron-electron interactions in a CNPJ at the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator thin film. Our findings signal the high tunability of the FD states of topological surface states in CNPJs that can be obtained by molecular beam epitaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Half moons", distinctive crescent patterns in the dynamical structure factor, have been identified in inelastic neutron scattering experiments for a wide range of frustrated magnets. In an earlier paper [H. Yan et al., Phys. Rev. B 98, 140402(R) (2018)] we have shown how these features are linked to the local constraints realized in classical spin liquids. Here we explore their implication for the topology of magnon bands. The presence of half moons indicates a separation of magnetic degrees of freedom into irrotational and incompressible components. Where bands satisfying these constraints meet, it is at a singular point encoding Berry curvature of $\pm 2\pi$. Interactions which mix the bands open a gap, resolving the singularity, and leading to bands with finite Berry curvature, accompanied by characteristic changes to half--moon motifs. These results imply that inelastic neutron scattering can, in some cases, be used to make rigorous inference about the topological nature of magnon bands.</description>

      <title>Theory of Topological Superconductivity and Antiferromagnetic Correlated Insulators in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers at filling $\nu=-1$, considerable interest has arisen in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model. Incorporating both onsite Hubbard repulsion and next-nearest-neighbor attraction, we then performed a mean-field analysis of the microscopic model and obtained a phase diagram qualitatively consistent with the experiment results. For zero or weak displacement field, the ground state is a Chern number $C=\pm 2$ topological superconductor in the Altland-Zirnbauer A-class (breaking time-reversal but preserving total $S_z$ symmetry) with inter-valley pairing dominant in $d_{xy}\pm id_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (mixing with a subdominant $p_x\mp i p_y$-wave) component. For a relatively strong displacement field, the ground state is a correlated insulator with the $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the twisted WSe$_2$ systems and suggest the need for further theoretical and experimental explorations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional nanoscale control of magnetism in crystalline Yttrium Iron Garnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exceptional magnetic, optical and phononic properties of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) make it unique for spin-wave based and photonic applications. Yet, nanostructuring crystalline YIG and manipulating its magnetism in a non-destructive way is an outstanding challenge, and so far mostly limited to two-dimensional capabilities. Here, we show that irradiation of single-crystal YIG films with a focused UV laser drives a stable, giant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, preserving the crystalline quality. This modulation is highly confined at the nanoscale in both the lateral and vertical directions, and its extension within the volume can be finely tuned with a continuous depth-control. By harnessing these three-dimensional anisotropy profiles, we demonstrate a large tuning of the spin-wave band structure, volume spatial localization, and non-reciprocity, realizing proof-of-principle 3D magnonic crystals. This straightforward, single-step, laser nanofabrication of three-dimensional magnetic systems based on crystalline YIG thin films opens the way to design novel functions in magnonic and magneto-optic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of magnetism is pivotal for elucidating the microscopic origins of magnetic phenomena in functional materials. However, for a specified class of materials, such as random dilute ferromagnets or alloys, the reliance on simplifying assumptions, such as single-ion anisotropy, limits the accuracy of existing spin models. In such systems, there is a significant probability of the formation of nearest-neighbor magnetic ion pairs or higher order clusters, whose presence breaks the local symmetry of otherwise isolated magnetic species. Here, we introduce the concept of pair-induced uniaxial anisotropy and demonstrate how nearby atoms influence each other's anisotropic behavior. This effect is investigated in the dilute magnetic semiconductor Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N, by means of density functional theory calculations. The inclusion of pair anisotropy in the atomistic spin simulations significantly improves the agreement between simulated and experimental magnetization curves, in contrast to models that consider only single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain in single van-der-Waals layer of MnBi2Te4 the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass (SG)/ferromagnet architecture, where the switch of individual spin states in the SG-like layer appears as the resistance switch behavior. The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the SG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale spintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet (FM/SG/FM) structure, the tunneling current is dominated by resistance switch (RS) instead of the local density of states according to the conventional tunneling theory. Here we show lattice-site dependent RS behaviors in one-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3 deposited on single MnBi2Te4 septuple layer, which comes from the difference in the efficiency of tunneling electrons to induce focused current or phonons at different sites, switching remotely the spin valve by spin-transfer torque or spin-phonon interactions. These lead to the observation of the dynamic 2-state lattice when the tip scans across the surface as well as the ability of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to reveal atomic-scale features of electron-phonon (EP) interactions. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the spin-switch STM to image lattice-site dependent EP interactions of any materials deposited on the FM/SG/FM structure.</description>

Abstract: We present a general mechanism for large charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures with a noncoplanar spin texture, formulated in terms of quantum-geometric phases. We present necessary conditions for this effect to occur, and show numerical results for disordered materials, relevant for applications. We calculate Josephson diode efficiencies for both charge- and spin-diodes and show that a spin-diode efficiency of 100% can be reached. Finally, we present a SQUID device that can switch between nearly pure spin-up and spin-down equal-spin supercurrents across the ferromagnet by reversing the flux. These findings establish functionalities that are absent for coplanar spin textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode effect (JDE) in strongly spin-polarized ferromagnets (sFM) coupled to singlet superconductors (SC) via ferromagnetic insulating interfaces (FI). All metallic parts are described in the framework of the quasiclassical Usadel Green's function theory applicable to diffusive systems. The interfaces are characterized by an S-matrix obtained for a model potential with exchange vectors pointing in an arbitrary direction with respect to the magnetization in the sFM. Our theory predicts a large charge Josephson diode effect with an efficiency exceeding $33\%$ and a perfect spin diode effect with $100\%$ efficiency. To achieve these the following conditions are necessary: (i) a noncoplanar profile of the three magnetization vectors in the system and (ii) different densities of states of spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\downarrow$ bands in the sFM achieved by a strong spin polarization. The former gives rise to the quantum-geometric phase, $\Delta\varphi$, that enters the theory in a very similar manner as the superconducting phase difference across the junction, $\Delta\chi$. We perform a harmonic analysis of the Josephson current in both variables and find symmetries between Fourier coefficients allowing an interpretation in terms of transfer processes of multiple equal-spin Cooper pairs across the two ferromagnetic spin bands. We point out the importance of crossed pair transmission processes. Finally, we study a spin-switching effect of an equal-spin supercurrent by reversing the magnetic flux in a SQUID device incorporating the mentioned junction and propose a way for measuring it.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Landauer's theory of ballistic transport in a one-dimensional (1D) conductor to situations where charge carrier injection and extraction are not any more confined to electrodes at either end of the channel, but may occur along its whole length. This type of distributed injection is expected to occur from the two-dimensional (2D) bulk of, e.g., a quantum spin (or anomalous) Hall insulator to its topologically protected edge states. We apply our conceptual solution to the case of two metal electrodes contacting the 2D bulk, enabling us to derive criteria that discriminate ballistic from resistive edge channels in multi-terminal transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Elastic Response and Instabilities of Anomalous Hall Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs) are exotic phases of matter that simultaneously break continuous translation symmetry and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. AHCs have recently been proposed as an explanation for the observation of an integer quantum anomalous Hall phase in a multilayer graphene system. Despite intense theoretical and experimental interest, little is known about the mechanical properties of AHCs. We study the elastic properties of AHCs, first by utilizing a continuum model with a quadratic dispersion and uniform Berry curvature. We find using time-dependent Hartree-Fock that the stiffness of the AHC is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the WC, which we attribute to the finite Chern number of the AHC preventing exponential localization of the charge density. By modifying the dispersion relation to include a local minimum modeled after that of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (R5G), we find that deformations away from the triangular lattice minimize the kinetic energy of the AHC, which overwhelms the small stiffness and generates a mechanical instability. Using a microscopic model of R5G, we observe a similar mechanical instability over an experimentally relevant parameter regime. We conclude that the topologically limited stiffness of AHCs makes them susceptible to mechanical instabilities, an important consideration when interpreting experiments in terms of AHCs.</description>

Abstract: We propose the use of the ``spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning (ML) input data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised ML, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions, and in a regression task to predict non-local observables. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Importantly, we illustrate a clear advantage of spin-opstring over conventional spin configurations in the accurate prediction of a quantum phase transition. Finally, we show how the inherent structure of spin-opstring provides an elegant framework for the interpretability of ML predictions. Using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the ML models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for ML in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Adaptive Virtual Imaging of Defects using EBSD</title>

Abstract: EBSD is a foundational technique for characterizing crystallographic orientation, phase distribution, and lattice strain. Embedded within EBSD patterns lies latent information on dislocation structures, subtly encoded due to their deviation from perfect crystallinity - a feature often underutilized. Here, a novel framework termed orientation-adaptive virtual apertures (OAVA) is introduced. OAVAs enable the generation of virtual images tied to specific diffraction conditions, allowing the direct visualization of individual dislocations from a single EBSD map. By dynamically aligning virtual apertures in reciprocal space with the local crystallographic orientation, the method enhances contrast from defect-related strain fields, mirroring the principles of diffraction-contrast imaging in TEM, but without sample tilting. The approach capitalizes on the extensive diffraction space captured in a single high-quality EBSD scan, with its effectiveness enhanced by modern direct electron detectors that offer high-sensitivity at low accelerating voltages, reducing interaction volume and improving spatial resolution. We demonstrate that using OAVAs, identical imaging conditions can be applied across a polycrystalline field-of-view, enabling uniform contrast in differently oriented grains. Furthermore, in single-crystal GaN, threading dislocations are consistently resolved. Algorithms for the automated detection of dislocation contrast are presented, advancing defect characterization. By using OAVAs across a wide range of diffraction conditions in GaN, the visibility/invisibility of defects, owing to the anisotropy of the elastic strain field, is assessed and linked to candidate Burgers vectors. Altogether, OAVA offers a new and high-throughput pathway for orientation-specific defect characterization with the potential for automated, large-area defect analysis in single and polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Evidence for energy-dependent scattering dominating thermoelectricity in heavy fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of thermoelectric materials and devices, improving energy conversion efficiency remains a long-standing challenge. As a promising approach to address this issue, utilizing energy-dependent electron-scattering beyond the ordinary constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) has been proposed. However, direct experimental evidence for an energy-dependent scattering reflected in the Seebeck coefficient is still lacking. Here we demonstrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the relaxation time of heavy fermion quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy near the Fermi level. The observed energy dependence of the relaxation time is due to the coherent Kondo scattering, describing the sign of the Seebeck coefficient reasonably well, which cannot be deduced from CRTA. Our findings provide not only deeper insight into the understanding of thermoelectricity in correlated materials, but also future perspectives on possible orbital-selective engineering of thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum dot energy levels in bilayer graphene: Exact and approximate study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In bilayer graphene the exact energy levels of quantum dots can be derived from the four-component continuum Hamiltonian. Here, we study the quantum dot energy levels with approximate equations and compare them with the exact levels. The starting point of our approach is the four-component continuum model and the quantum dot is defined by a continuous potential well in a uniform magnetic field. Using some simple arguments we demonstrate realistic regimes where approximate quantum dot equations can be derived. Interestingly these approximate equations can be solved semi-analytically, in the same context as a single-component Schr\"odinger equation. The approximate equations provide valuable insight into the physics with minimal numerical effort compared with the four-component quantum dot model. We show that the approximate quantum dot energy levels agree very well with the exact levels in a broad range of parameters and find realistic regimes where the relative error is vanishingly small.</description>

      <title>Colossal dielectric response of HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a colossal dielectric response of small (5 - 10 nm) oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles (x = 1 - 0.4), prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The effective dielectric permittivity of the pressed HfxZr1-xO2 nanopowders has a pronounced maximum at 38 - 88 C, which shape can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss type dependence modified for the diffuse ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The maximal value of the dielectric permittivity increases from 1.5*10^3 (for x = 1) to 1.5*10^5 (for x= 0.4) at low frequencies (~4 Hz); being much smaller, namely changing from 7 (for x = 1) to 20 (for x = 0.4) at high frequencies (~500 kHz). The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity maximum position is almost absent, meanwhile the shape and width of the maximum changes in a complex way with increase in frequency. The temperature dependencies of the dielectric permittivity and resistivity are almost mirror-like turned over in respect to each other, which means that all their features, such as position and shape of maxima, plateau, minima and inflexions, almost coincide after the mirror reflection in respect to the temperature axis. These correlations of resistivity and dielectric permittivity are well-described in the Heywang barrier model applied together with the variable range hopping conduction model in semiconducting ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric-like behavior of the small oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles is expected from the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory calculations. Obtained results may be useful for developing silicon-compatible functional nanomaterials based on HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Zeeman Quantum Geometry as a Probe of Unconventional Magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional magnets with momentum-dependent spin-splitting but zero net magnetization form a recently identified class of collinear magnets that are challenging to probe via conventional means. We show that these systems can be distinguished through their intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) currents, enabled by the Zeeman quantum geometry, which captures the coupled response of electronic states to momentum translation and spin rotation. Examining two prototypical two-dimensional unconventional magnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a time-reversal-broken $d$-wave altermagnet and a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, we uncover a direct link between crystalline symmetry, spin-split band structures, and transport signatures. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet exhibits both transverse conduction and longitudinal displacement IGM currents, whereas the $p$-wave magnet supports only a transverse conduction IGM current. Remarkably, the mixed $d$-wave altermagnet supports all four types of IGM currents, including a longitudinal conduction current enabled by symmetric (Zeeman) Berry curvature that is forbidden in conventional quantum geometry. These responses, measurable via Hall transport and optical probes, persist even when conventional quantum geometry-driven linear responses vanish, offering unique access to hidden spin-split band structures. Our results establish Zeeman quantum geometry as both a diagnostic tool and a design principle for novel magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-wave propagation at low temperatures in YIG thin films on YSGG substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of spin waves in magnetic thin films at cryogenic temperatures has long been hindered by the lack of a suitable material platform. Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the leading candidate, yet it is typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates, which develop a large paramagnetic moment at low temperatures. This substrate effect limits spin-wave propagation. In this work, we demonstrate that thin YIG films grown on yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) substrates support robust spin-wave propagation in the Damon-Eshbach geometry, measurable down to 2 K under applied magnetic fields up to 150 mT. Compared with YIG/GGG, YIG/YSGG films exhibit narrower ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidths at low temperatures and are free from the atomic interdiffusion effects that degrade the performance of YIG/GGG systems. These results establish YIG/YSGG thin films as a promising low-temperature platform, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of YIG/GGG and opening new opportunities for scalable magnonic and hybrid quantum devices operating under cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Stability of graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under harsh conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon atoms assume positions just some tenths of \r{A} from the mathematical hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$ elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene shapes that are to be produced experimentally.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title>

Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy of amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ compounds deposited by magnetron sputtering change with film thickness from in plane to out of plane anisotropy at thickness above 40 nm. Xray reflectivity measurements shows the progressive formation of an additional layer in between the 3 nm thick Si capping layer and the NdCo compound film. Hard Xray Photoemission spectroscoy (HAXPES) was used to analyze the composition and distribution of cobalt and neodymium at the top layers region of NdCo$_{4.6}$ films of thickness ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm using 7 keV, 10 keV and 13 keV incident photon energies, with inelastic electron mean free paths ranging from 7.2 nm to 12.3 nm in cobalt. The atomic cobalt concentration of the alloy deduced from HAXPES measurements at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations results to be below the nominal value, changing with thickness and incident photon energy. This proves a segregation of the rare earth at the surface of the NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin film which increases with thickness. The analysis of the background of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks was consistent with this conclusion. This demonstrates that neodymium incorporation in the cobalt lattice have a cost in energy which can be associated to strain due to the difference in volume between the two elements. The lowering of this strain energy will favor atomic anisotropic environments for neodymium that explains the perpendicular anisotropy and its thickness dependence of these NdCo compound films.</description>

Abstract: Chiral phonons, originally identified in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and later extended to kagome, square, and other lattices, have been extensively studied as manifestations of broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries in vibrational dynamics. In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors. From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon modes.</description>

      <title>Coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid in mechanical nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.</description>

Abstract: We address the inverse problem for the mean-field Ising model with two- and three-body interactions using a Bayesian framework. Parameter recovery in this setting is notoriously difficult, particularly near phase transitions, at criticality, and under non-identifiability, where conventional estimators and standard MCMC samplers fail. To overcome these challenges, we develop a hybrid algorithm that combines Adaptive Metropolis Hastings with geometry-aware Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian dynamics. This approach yields substantially improved mixing and convergence in the three-dimensional parameter space. Through simulated experiments across representative regimes, we demonstrate that the method achieves accurate density reconstruction and reliable uncertainty quantification even in settings where existing approaches are unstable or inapplicable.</description>

Abstract: Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in aluminum nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and other optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a theoretical study of hot-carrier generation in aluminum nanospheres using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding simulations. Different from standard plasmonic metals, such as gold or silver, we find that the energetic distribution of hot electrons and holes in aluminium nanoparticles is almost constant for all allowed energies. Only at relatively high photon energies, a reduction of the generation rate of highly energetic holes and electrons close to the Fermi level is observed which is attributed to band structure effects suppressing interband decay channels. We also investigate the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle diameter and the environment dielectric constant. The insights from our study can inform experimental efforts towards highly efficient aluminum-based hot-carrier devices.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</description>
